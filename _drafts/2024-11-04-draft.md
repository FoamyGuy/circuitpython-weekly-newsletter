Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.24.0 Released

[![MicroPython v1.24.0](../assets/20241104/20241104mp24.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0)

MicroPython v1.24.0 adds support for the new Raspberry Pi RP2350 MCU, improved RISC-V support with native code generation, support for ESP32-C6 MCUs, updates the Zephyr version with threading support, unified TinyUSB bindings across ports, a portable UART IRQ API, and enhanced mpremote recursive copy. There are also numerous bug fixes, enhancements to the test suite and more attention to testing of the machine module and its API. Read on for more details.

Support for the RISC-V architecture has been significantly extended, to include an RV32IMC native code emitter, native NLR and GC register scanning implementations for 32- and 64-bit RISC-V, support for placing RV32IMC native code in .mpy files and also freezing it, and RISC-V semihosting support. Testing for RISC-V is done with the qemu and unix ports, and the support is utilised in the esp32 and rp2 ports.

There is now support concatenation of adjacent f-strings, as well as raw f-strings. There is also a new micropython.RingIO class which provides a stream interface to an efficient, thread-safe, byte-oriented ring-buffer implementation.

All the ports that use TinyUSB have now been unified to use the same shared helper code for CDC serial. This includes: esp32 (S2 and S3), mimxrt, renesas-ra, rp2 and samd ports. With this has come the useful feature that the startup CDC serial data is buffered and then sent to the host upon connection. This means that (among other things) the REPL banner and initial prompt is now seen on first connection to a board - [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0).

## A New Release of Raspberry Pi OS

[![New Release of Raspberry Pi OS](../assets/20241104/20241104pios.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/)

Raspberry Pi has released a new version of Raspberry Pi OS. This version includes a significant change, albeit one that we hope most people won’t even notice. The Wayland compositor for window handling is now turned on by default for all models - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/l).

> "For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process with the developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us immensely with their support as we contribute features and optimisations needed for our desktop. After much optimisation for our hardware, we have reached the point where labwc desktops run just as fast as X on older Raspberry Pi models. Today, we make the switch with our latest desktop image: Raspberry Pi Desktop now runs Wayland by default across all models. When you update an existing installation of Bookworm, you will see a prompt asking to switch to labwc the next time you reboot."

## CircuitPython 9.2.0 Released

[![CircuitPython 9.2.0 Released](../assets/20241104/20241104cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/10/28/circuitpython-9-2-0-released/)

CircuitPython 9.2.0, the latest minor revision of CircuitPython (although packed with enough for a major step), is a new stable release. - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/10/28/circuitpython-9-2-0-released/) and [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.0).

**Highlights of this release**
- Fix RP2350 cache invalidation for PSRAM.

**Notable changes in 9.2.0 from 9.1.x**

text.

**Tim**

This week I implemented a handful of new features and fixes to the circuitpython.org website that were found in the GitHub issues, [there is a blogpost detailing them](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/10/29/roundup-of-circuitpython-org-changes-circuitpython/). I also worked with Liz on the driver for the VCNL4200 device. Lastly I've been working on a new learn guide covering how to create custom Animations for use with the `adafruit_led_animation` library, I've created a handful of new animations to use as examples to explain different concepts.

**Jeff**

I've been working on a requested enhancement to `synthio`: biquad filters whose properties (central frequency & sharpness) can be adjusted at runtime or by LFOs. As I write this, the PR is pending review.

This week I've been working with Tim on the [VCNL4200 CircuitPython driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_VCNL4200). This driver has a lot of registers to port compared to what our sensors normally have so it has been nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of and double check that the hardware is working as expected. A guide for this sensor will be published soon with example code in CircuitPython and Arduino.

I also setup a Raspberry Pi 5 for the first time. While working on this, I referenced Carter's [excellent guide on setting up and using a virtual environment with Python](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi). If you've been confused on the venv Python chatter in regard to the Pi, or in general, definitely check it out as an excellent reference.
