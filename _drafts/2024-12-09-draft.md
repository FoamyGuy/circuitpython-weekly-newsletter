## Raspberry Pi Release `piolib` for Raspberry Pi 5 RP1 Programming

[![piolib](../assets/20241209/20241209pio.jpg)](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/tree/master/piolib)

PIOlib/libPIO is a user-space API to the `rp1-pio` driver, which gives access to the PIO hardware of the RP1 on a Raspberry Pi 5. It takes the form of a clone of the PICO SDK PIO API, where most of the methods are implemented as RPC calls to RP1 - [GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/tree/master/piolib) and [NeoPixel Example](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/blob/master/piolib/examples/ws2812.c).

## An Updated CircuitPython Plug-in for VSCode is Available

[![CircuitPython Plug-in for VSCode](../assets/20241209/20241209vsc.jpg)](https://github.com/wmerkens/vscode-circuitpython)

Will S Merkens has come to the rescue of many in the community who have asked for a working VSCode extension for CircuitPython development. Will forked an older, broken version and has applied fixes - [GitHub](https://github.com/wmerkens/vscode-circuitpython).

## Arduino Releases Its First Zephyr Cores, as It Makes the Move Away From Arm's Discontinued Mbed

[![Arduino Releases Its First Zephyr Cores](../assets/20241209/20241209az.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-releases-its-first-zephyr-cores-as-it-makes-the-move-away-from-arm-s-discontinued-mbed-0259a47ff179)

Arduino has released its first microcontroller cores to feature the Zephyr real-time operating system, as it looks to transition away from Arm's discontinued Mbed platform for its devices — with beta builds now available - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-releases-its-first-zephyr-cores-as-it-makes-the-move-away-from-arm-s-discontinued-mbed-0259a47ff179).

> "Last July, when we announced the beginning of the transition from Mbed to Zephyr, we promised to release the first beta by the end of 2024," the Arduino team explains. "Today, we are excited to announce the first release of Arduino cores with ZephyrOS in beta! We are transitioning Arduino cores to ZephyrOS to ensure continued support and innovation for developers. This change follows Arm’s deprecation of MbedOS, which has historically powered some of our cores."

## Raspberry Pi Boosts Pi 5 Performance With SDRAM Tuning

[![Raspberry Pi boosts Pi 5 performance with SDRAM tuning](../assets/20241209/20241209tune.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning)

Raspberry Pi engineers tweaked SDRAM timings and other memory settings on the Pi, resulting in a 10-20% speed boost at the default 2.4 GHz clock. Jeff Geerling tested overclocking, which resulted in a 32% speedup at 3.2 GHz. Changes may roll out in a firmware update for all Pi 5 and Pi 4 users soon - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning).

## 10 Python Libraries Every Developer Should Know

[![10 Python Libraries Every Developer Should Know](../assets/20241209/20241209lib.jpg)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-python-libraries-every-developer-should-know)

Are you a developer who enjoys coding in Python? If so, there are a few (big) Python libraries you can add to your dev toolbox. As a developer, you should be comfortable with debugging, logging, and unit testing. Besides, you’ll need to work with data sources, account for data validation, and build APIs - [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-python-libraries-every-developer-should-know).

## Project of the Week: Porting Adventure to MicroPython

[![Porting Adventure to MicroPython](../assets/20241209/20241209adv.jpg)](https://udel.edu/~mm/hp/adventure/)

In 1977, on a DEC PDP-10, the text game Adventure was coded in FORTRAN and countless CPU hours have been burned by players worldwide playing it. Mike Markowski decided to port the FORTRAN ([here](https://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/adv350-pdp10.tar.gz)) into MicroPython. Success is having a running version on an HP Prime calculator and PC - [Mike Markowski](https://udel.edu/~mm/hp/adventure/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241209/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I am adding a CircuitPython interface to cryptographic functionality provided by mbedTLS. We'll use that functionality to do crypography for CircuitMatter in CircuitPython.

**Tim**

I have been continuing to work on issues in the Libraries. This week I worked on a few fixes in the turtle graphics repo. I've added TypeAnnotations to a few libraries and am moving them to use ruff in their GitHub Actions as well so that the annotations and ruff change can go under a single release. I also worked on a change to circuitpython.org to split up the raspberrypi processor family into rp2040 and rp2350 so that it's possible to search by the specific chip now.

**Jeff**

I've been back to working on CircuitPython bugs, including work to resolve an audio glitch that occurred when using the `MP3Decoder.open` method to switch streams before an earlier stream finished.

**Scott**

I've started prototyping building CircuitPython on top of Zephyr. I'm using my own async Python code to build the CircuitPython bits when delegated to from Zephyr's cmake. I've gotten it to the point that linking CircuitPython is missing core pieces like flash functions. This means I'm starting to interface from CircuitPython into the Zephyr APIs. The main benefit of this is that these implementations will work for any Zephyr supported board!

**Liz**

I took last week off for the Thanksgiving holiday. It was a nice restful break and now I’m ready to pump out some work between now and Christmas/New Years. Before my week-long nap, I published the [Feather RP2350 Audio Reactive Video Synth guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-rp2350-audio-reactive-video-synth). This project uses a Feather RP2350 with HSTX to DVI to run a video synthesizer that uses analog potentiometers and audio input with FFT to control fun animations. I’m really proud of this project. It had been a goal of mine to work on a video synth in CircuitPython and I was thrilled to finally be able to do it with bonus points for audio reactivity.

## Upcoming Events
