Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Midsummer is a time when Americans bake in the sun and Finns bask by the lake at a cottage. No matter how you are handling the season, you can leisurly browse this issue. We reported not long ago that Mbed OS was end of life and that left Arduino in a lurch. No more, as Arduino just announced their embrace of Zephyr OS, a good choice. A new maintenance release of CircuitPython is out now. And this issue has a focus on cool projects in the summer heat. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Arduino to Switch From Arm Mbed to Zephyr Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

[![Arduino to Switch](../assets/20240729/20240729arduino.jpg)](https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/07/25/arduino-to-switch-from-arm-mbed-to-zephyr-rtos/)

Following Arm’s decision to stop supporting Mbed from July 2026 onwards, Arduino has now decided to use Zephyr RTOS instead of Arm Mbed for Arduino boards that rely on the latter including Arduino GIGA, Arduino Nano 33 BLE, Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, as well as Arduino PRO boards/solutions such as the Portenta, Nicla, and Opta families. Arduino plans to release the first beta of their transition by the end of 2024, with a rollout for various boards starting in 2025 - [CNX Software](https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/07/25/arduino-to-switch-from-arm-mbed-to-zephyr-rtos/) and [Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2024/07/24/the-end-of-mbed-marks-a-new-beginning-for-arduino/).

## Project of the Week: Implementing DDP in MicroPython

[![Implementing DDP in MicroPython](../assets/20240729/20240729ddp.jpg)](https://chaos.social/@scy/112838820313420247)

scy on Mastodon was looking at using either Art-Net or Distributed Display Protocol ([DDP](http://www.3waylabs.com/ddp/)) for a project. After looking at the specs, he chose DDP - [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@scy/112838820313420247).

> DDP is so simple that I wrote a hacky, rudimentary server for it in about 50 lines of MicroPython, from scratch, in about an hour. Uploaded it to an ESP32, pointed a WLED controller at it and everything worked on the first attempt.

FutureBoard is a main control board designed for STEM education in the future. It has many built-in sensors just like the micro:bit, but unlike the micro:bit, FutureBoard features a TFT screen capable of displaying full colors. It supports MicroPython coding, allowing for more advanced learning - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/kittenbot/futureboard-dd1746).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.1.1 last week to fix a problem with the display backlight not illuminating on SAMD51 boards like the PyPortal. The release also includes a few other fixes.

I'm continuing to fix bugs in the 9.1.x milestone and I'm also continuing the merge from MicroPython v1.22.

**Melissa**

This past week I set up a beta website for [code.circuitpython.org](http://code.circuitpython.org/). The URL for the new site is [https://code-beta.circuitpython.org](https://code-beta.circuitpython.org/) if you would like to give it a try. Currently though, it contains the same code as code.circuitpython.org, but the plan is to push changes there first to avoid breaking code.circuitpython.org.

**Tim**

I've been working on fixing a few `displayio` driver libraries that have compatibility issue with the latest version of `Blinka_Displayio`. I've also started switching library repos to use Ruff instead of pylint and Black. I'm making that swap on libraries as I come across them reviewing other changes or working on other things. I chased down an issue with SAMD51 devices that have built-in displays to find the specific commit where the problems began.

**Jeff**

This week my work to add support for IPv6 on most Espressif boards was merged into to the very latest versions of CircuitPython. For now, the documentation is shoe-horned into the "[Internet Test](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/circuitpython-internet-test#ipv6-networking-3176506)" page on Learn. The tl;dr is: `wifi.radio.start_dhcp_server(ipv6=True)` and then create sockets with `AF_INET6`.

Libraries that build on socketpool, like adafruit_requests and adafruit_ntp will require their own updates to work with IPv6, because they always request IPv4 sockets via AF_INET.

You won't see any updates from me over the next few weeks, as I'm taking a vacation!

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on CircuitMatter. I've reconnected things to the network and have successfully replied to the controller! The next task is to implement the cryptography functions used to establish a secure message channel. I'm testing with a test controller on my desktop now and can also record and replay packets on the Python device side.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a fun project with the Ruiz brothers to showcase BLE on ESP32-S3: the [ESP32-S3 BLE iOS Media Controller](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-ble-ios-media-controller). This project uses an ESP32-S3 Feather with a TFT FeatherWing to display and control Apple Media services over BLE.

I also worked on two product guides. The first was the [CH334F USB Hub Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch334f-mini-4-port-usb-hub-breakout). This breakout lets you easily build a custom USB hub, no code required. The second was for the [USB Type C Power Delivery Switchable Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-usb-type-c-power-delivery-switchable-breakout). This board is a remix of the original HUSB238 breakout in the shop. This version features DIP switches to select the PD voltage instead of solder jumpers. Working on the original breakout got me very interested in weird USB power methods so I'm excited to have a version that doesn't require soldering.
