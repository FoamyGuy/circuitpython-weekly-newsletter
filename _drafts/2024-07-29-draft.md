## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240729/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **489**!

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.1.1 last week to fix a problem with the display backlight not illuminating on SAMD51 boards like the PyPortal. The release also includes a few other fixes.

I'm continuing to fix bugs in the 9.1.x milestone and I'm also continuing the merge from MicroPython v1.22.

**Melissa**

**Tim**

I've been working on fixing a few `displayio` driver libraries that have compatibility issue with the latest version of `Blinka_Displayio`. I've also started switching library repos to use Ruff instead of pylint and Black. I'm making that swap on libraries as I come across them reviewing other changes or working on other things. I chased down an issue with SAMD51 devices that have built-in displays to find the specific commit where the problems began.

**Jeff**

This week my work to add support for IPv6 on most Espressif boards was merged into to the very latest versions of CircuitPython. For now, the documentation is shoe-horned into the "[Internet Test](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/circuitpython-internet-test#ipv6-networking-3176506)" page on Learn. The tl;dr is: `wifi.radio.start_dhcp_server(ipv6=True)` and then create sockets with `AF_INET6`.

Libraries that build on socketpool, like adafruit_requests and adafruit_ntp will require their own updates to work with IPv6, because they always request IPv4 sockets via AF_INET.

You won't see any updates from me over the next few weeks, as I'm taking a vacation!

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on CircuitMatter. I've reconnected things to the network and have successfully replied to the controller! The next task is to implement the cryptography functions used to establish a secure message channel. I'm testing with a test controller on my desktop now and can also record and replay packets on the Python device side.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a fun project with the Ruiz brothers to showcase BLE on ESP32-S3: the [ESP32-S3 BLE iOS Media Controller](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-ble-ios-media-controller). This project uses an ESP32-S3 Feather with a TFT FeatherWing to display and control Apple Media services over BLE.

I also worked on two product guides. The first was the [CH334F USB Hub Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch334f-mini-4-port-usb-hub-breakout). This breakout lets you easily build a custom USB hub, no code required. The second was for the [USB Type C Power Delivery Switchable Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-usb-type-c-power-delivery-switchable-breakout). This board is a remix of the original HUSB238 breakout in the shop. This version features DIP switches to select the PD voltage instead of solder jumpers. Working on the original breakout got me very interested in weird USB power methods so I'm excited to have a version that doesn't require soldering.

## Upcoming Events
