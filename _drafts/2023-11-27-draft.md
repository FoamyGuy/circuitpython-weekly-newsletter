Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We at Adafruit hope you all had a good week and holidays this past week. It's always a good month for buying open source hardware guifts from companies and there are more options than ever. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## A Raspberry Pi 5 Review

[![Raspberry Pi 5 Review](../assets/20231127/20231127p5.jpg)](https://bret.dk/raspberry-pi-5-review/)

A comprehensive review of the Raspberry Pi 5 - [bret.dk](https://bret.dk/raspberry-pi-5-review/).

>"My Raspberry Pi 5 review will cover a wide range of areas, with comparisons to some of the existing options available on the market, and help you decide whether the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s latest offering is the one for you."

Whilst I’m comparing a range of other boards such as the older sibling, the Raspberry Pi 4, the Libre Computer Alta, Radxa’s ROCK 5B, and an Intel N100 system

## Talking To An Oscilloscope with Python

[![Talking To An Oscilloscope with Python](../assets/20231127/20231127scope.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/how-to-talk-to-your-oscilloscope-python-hackaday/)

Historically, test gear used IEEE-488/GPIB/HPIB. Today, a device will likely talk over a USB port, a serial port, or a LAN connection. Each vendor and even model has its unique command language. There has been a significant effort to standardize some aspects of test instrument control, and you can quickly write code to control things on any platform. The key is to use VISA. This protocol, defined by the IVI Foundation, lets you talk to instruments regardless of how they communicate - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/11/21/how-to-talk-to-your-scope/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/how-to-talk-to-your-oscilloscope-python-hackaday/).

## An Interactive Display for Finding Wheelchair-Accessible Places

[![Interactive Display for Finding Wheelchair-Accessible Places](../assets/20231127/20231127disp.gif)](https://www.hackster.io/rhammell/interactive-display-for-finding-wheelchair-accessible-places-6020f1)

A touch-enabled display searches for and maps the location of wheelchair-accessible places around a user-defined location. This is done with an Adafruit PyPortal and CircuitPython along with Adafruit IO, Geoapify and Google Places - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/rhammell/interactive-display-for-finding-wheelchair-accessible-places-6020f1).

## Low-Cost Volcanic Activity Detection with Raspberry Pi Cameras

[![Volcanic activity detection](../assets/20231127/20231127co2.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/low-cost-volcanic-activity-detection-with-raspberry-pi-cameras/)

A team of researchers from Chile, Australia, the US, and the UK have found a more affordable method to capture volcanic activity by detecting sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. While SO2 cameras do already exist, they’re usually expensive, so the team harnessed the more affordable Raspberry Pi cameras to create their solution. Data acquisition is controlled by software written in Python 3, which is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/twVolc/PyCamPermanent) - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/low-cost-volcanic-activity-detection-with-raspberry-pi-cameras/) and the scientific paper in [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1088992/full).

## HackSpace Magazine Issue 72 - Raspberry Pi 5 Projects

[![HackSpace Magazine](../assets/20231127/20231127hs.jpg)](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.com/issues/72)

## Using a CB Radio on Your PC With CircuitPython

[![CB Radio on Your PC With CircuitPython](../assets/20231127/20231127cb.jpg)](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/delchi/pages/cb-microphone-for-your-pc-breaker-breaker-any-takers)

Adafruit Playground member delchi writes: "I was looking for some new gaming frontiers when I came across truck simulators! All the skill & thrill of a big rig from your PC. As with all simulators there are button boxes and realistic cockpits to buy, but one thing I didn't see was a CB radio mic! They expect us to use desktop mics, headsets or some other hoo-haw instead of the ol jabberjaw microphone! A little deeper digging showed that you can buy adapters, but they ranged from $180 to $300!"

Instead, delchi built an interface using an Adafruit QT Py RP2040 and CircuitPython to implement push to talk (PTT) in simulators using USB HID - [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/delchi/pages/cb-microphone-for-your-pc-breaker-breaker-any-takers).

## Project of the Week: A Projection Clock With a Vacuum Fluorescent Display

[![Projection Clock](../assets/20231127/20231127clock.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/20/making-a-projection-clock-with-a-vacuum-fluorescent-display/)

The VFD Night Projector Clock may be the first projecting clock that uses a VFD display. One trick to having the time project is to use a camera lens to focus the light on the ceiling. The project uses MicroPython on an STM32 microcontroller - [GitHub](https://github.com/shufps/vfd-night-projector-clock) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/20/making-a-projection-clock-with-a-vacuum-fluorescent-display/).

[![Album](../assets/20231127/20231127album.jpg)](https://faircamp.axwax.eu/axwax-dawless-jams-1/)

An album made using electronic instruments including a Raspbbery Pi Pico with MicroPython - [faircamp.axwax.eu](https://faircamp.axwax.eu/axwax-dawless-jams-1/).

> "I haven't really made a proper post about my first solo and Faircamp-exclusive E.P, so it's time to rectify that. It's a collection of my DAWless jams, recorded between August 2021 and April 2022. As there is no MIDI or sequencer on the Werkstatt, I wrote a hacky MicroPython script to produce a hardcoded, but MIDI-synced arpeggio on CV1 and a user-controllable envelope generator on CV2."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm fixing bugs for the 8.2.x and 9.0.0 milestones, looking toward the medium-term goal of a 9.0.0 release. At the moment I'm looking at ESP32-S3 BLE issues, but I've fixed a number of other more minor issues. Re-testing has shown some problems have been fixed by the upgrade to ESP-IDF v5.1 and the recent MicroPython merges, and require no further work. Other issues require more thorough debugging. We are steadily reducing the issue list.

**Melissa**

**Tim**

text - [site](url).

**Jeff**

I've started working on a web-based UI for the OV5640 camera together with the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. Hopefully in the end this will allow streaming camera data in low resolution, setting the camera parameters (such as effect, exposure, etc) and downloading full-resolution images. At this time, it only works with commandline requests by curl, but it's a start.

When not working on this demo, I've been working in various small ways on CircuitPython 9. For instance, I noticed that not all of our tests were being performed when we built CircuitPython, and fixed it.

**Scott**

I'm keeping up with emails and PRs but not much else. I've been spending lots of time with family due to my mom's failing health.

**Liz**

[![Liz](../assets/20231127/20231127liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I worked on a [1 minute video](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZCI8Wb70Xhc) to showcase using a CIRCUITPY drive with an Android device. I also worked on updating the [3.5" TFT FeatherWing guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-3-5-tft-featherwing) for the V2 version of the board that was released last week.

In personal hardware news, I happened to come across an infamous Meowsic cat piano on the side of the road during a walk this week that was in purrfect condition after a little clean-up. This is the same keyboard that [JP featured in a few Learn Guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/meowsic-line-out). I'm excited to do my own mods soon.
