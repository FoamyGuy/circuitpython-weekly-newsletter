Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We at Adafruit hope you all a good week. It's always a good month for buying open source hardware gifts from companies and there are more options than ever. This issue primarily focuses on some really nice projects - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4s Coming Back Into the Retail Channel

[![Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4s Coming Back Into the Retail Channel](../assets/20231127/20231127cm4.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/so-you-want-make-raspberry-pi-killer#comments)

Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards have been rather scarce since 2021. Jeff Geerling notes that supplies are easing in line with what Eben Upton predicted ([rpilocator](https://rpilocator.com/?cat=CM4)). Jeff also discusses alternate CM4 form factor boards and the state of the ecosphere - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/so-you-want-make-raspberry-pi-killer#comments).

## Talking To An Oscilloscope with Python

[![Talking To An Oscilloscope with Python](../assets/20231127/20231127scope.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/how-to-talk-to-your-oscilloscope-python-hackaday/)

Historically, test gear used an IEEE-488/GPIB/HPIB port for communications. Today, a device will likely talk over a USB port, a serial port, or a LAN connection. Each vendor and model has its unique command language. There has been a significant effort to standardize some aspects of test instrument control, and you can quickly write code to control things on any platform. The key is to use VISA. This protocol, defined by the IVI Foundation, lets you talk to instruments regardless of how they communicate - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/11/21/how-to-talk-to-your-scope/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/how-to-talk-to-your-oscilloscope-python-hackaday/).

## Limor Fried’s code is often a de facto standard, and now ChatGPT is using it

[![Limor Fried’s code is often a de facto standard, and now ChatGPT is using it](../assets/20231127/20231127limor.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/limor-frieds-code-is-often-a-de-facto-standard-and-now-chatgpt-is-using-it-adafruit-chatgpt-ai-ieeespectrum-limorfried/)

IEEE Spectrum writes this past week about [Limor Fried](https://spectrum.ieee.org/profile-limor-fried), the founder of Adafruit. The open-source microcontroller driver libraries she writes to interface with devices such as sensors and displays often become de facto standards and are found in many code repositories. Recently, Fried began experimenting with ChatGPT to generate drivers and discovered that the AI was writing in her own particular style - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-code) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/22/limor-frieds-code-is-often-a-de-facto-standard-and-now-chatgpt-is-using-it-adafruit-chatgpt-ai-ieeespectrum-limorfried/).

## Low-Cost Volcanic Activity Detection with Raspberry Pi Cameras

[![Volcanic activity detection](../assets/20231127/20231127co2.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/low-cost-volcanic-activity-detection-with-raspberry-pi-cameras/)

A team of researchers from Chile, Australia, the US, and the UK have found a more affordable method to capture volcanic activity by detecting sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. While SO2 cameras do already exist, they’re usually expensive, so the team harnessed the more affordable Raspberry Pi cameras to create their solution. Data acquisition is controlled by software written in Python 3, which is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/twVolc/PyCamPermanent) - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/low-cost-volcanic-activity-detection-with-raspberry-pi-cameras/) and the scientific paper in [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1088992/full).

## Using a CB Radio on Your PC With CircuitPython

[![CB Radio on Your PC With CircuitPython](../assets/20231127/20231127cb.jpg)](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/delchi/pages/cb-microphone-for-your-pc-breaker-breaker-any-takers)

Adafruit Playground member delchi writes: "I was looking for some new gaming frontiers when I came across truck simulators! All the skill & thrill of a big rig from your PC. As with all simulators, there are button boxes and realistic cockpits to buy, but one thing I didn't see was a CB radio mic! They expect us to use desktop mics, headsets or some other hoo-haw instead of the ol' jabberjaw microphone! A little deeper digging showed that you can buy adapters, but they ranged from $180 to $300!"

Instead, delchi built an interface using an Adafruit QT Py RP2040 and CircuitPython to implement push to talk (PTT) in simulators using USB HID - [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/delchi/pages/cb-microphone-for-your-pc-breaker-breaker-any-takers).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm fixing bugs for the 8.2.x and 9.0.0 milestones, looking toward the medium-term goal of a 9.0.0 release. At the moment I'm looking at ESP32-S3 BLE issues, but I've fixed a number of other more minor issues. Re-testing has shown some problems have been fixed by the upgrade to ESP-IDF v5.1 and the recent MicroPython merges, and require no further work. Other issues require more thorough debugging. We are steadily reducing the issue list.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on refactoring some proposed code for circup that adds support for interacting with devices via the web workflow. I had to learn about the pytest mocking module in order to update the tests to work with the newly refactored version of circup. I've also been doing testing on proposed changes in the MiniMQTT library.

**Jeff**

I've started working on a web-based UI for the OV5640 camera together with the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. Hopefully, in the end, this will allow streaming camera data in low resolution, setting the camera parameters (such as effect, exposure, etc.) and downloading full-resolution images. At this time, it only works with commandline requests by curl, but it's a start.

When not working on this demo, I've been working in various small ways on CircuitPython 9. For instance, I noticed that not all of our tests were being performed when we built CircuitPython, and fixed it.

**Scott**

I'm keeping up with emails and PRs but not much else. I've been spending lots of time with family due to my mom's failing health.

**Liz**

[![Liz](../assets/20231127/20231127liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I worked on a [1 minute video](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZCI8Wb70Xhc) to showcase using a CIRCUITPY drive with an Android device. I also worked on updating the [3.5" TFT FeatherWing guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-3-5-tft-featherwing) for the V2 version of the board that was released last week.

In personal hardware news, I happened to come across an infamous Meowsic cat piano on the side of the road during a walk this week that was in purrfect condition after a little clean-up. This is the same keyboard that [JP featured in a few Learn Guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/meowsic-line-out). I'm excited to do my own mods soon.
