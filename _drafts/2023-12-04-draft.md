## Eben Upton Hints at an RP2040 Successor, Promises a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 in 2024

[![Eben Upton Hints at an RP2040 Successor, Promises a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 in 2024](../assets/20231204/20231204rp2040.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/eben-upton-hints-at-an-rp2040-successor-promises-a-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-in-2024-ec331994aca3)

Eben Upton hints at an RP2040 successor, promises a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 in 2024 - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/eben-upton-hints-at-an-rp2040-successor-promises-a-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-in-2024-ec331994aca3).

> "We know what people don't like [and] what people do like," Upton says, "and we have a chip team."

## Microsoft Releases ThreadX RTOS, Used in Raspberry Pi Boards, as Open Source

[![Microsoft opens sources ThreadX](../assets/20231204/20231204x.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/28/microsoft_opens_sources_threadx/)

Microsoft opens sources ThreadX under MIT license. The 'Azure RTOS', used in millions of Raspberry Pis, is now open source - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/28/microsoft_opens_sources_threadx/).

> ThreadX was quite pervasive... Microsoft claims 12 billion devices run it, and you might own some of them. It is the firmware that controls every Raspberry Pi bigger than the Pi Pico. On the Pi 1, 2 and 3, it's the file on your Pi's SD card called bootcode.bin; in the Pi 4 and 400, it's called start*.elf. Even though it's on GitHub and included in Debian, it's a proprietary "blob" (Binary Large OBject). It's a metaphorical sealed black box which doesn't even contain Arm code: instead, it runs on the Pi's VideoCore GPU. This is the primary device, the part that boots up the Pi and controls its hardware.

## The Python Software Foundation Bristles at Looming European Cybersecurity Rules on Open Source Software

[![Looming European Cybersecurity Rules](../assets/20231204/20231204eu.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/12/python_management_eu/)

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is concerned that proposed EU cybersecurity laws will leave open source organizations and individuals unfairly liable for distributing incorrect code - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/12/python_management_eu/).

> "If the proposed law is enforced as currently written, the authors of open-source components might bear legal and financial responsibility for the way their components are applied in someone else's commercial product," the PSF said in a statement shared on Tuesday by executive director Deb Nicholson.

## Using an External GPUs on the Raspberry Pi 5

[![Using an External GPUs on the Raspberry Pi 5](../assets/20231204/20231204gpu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLg-1w2QayU)

When the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 came out, folks worked very hard to get the single PCIe lane working with external hardware with mixed results. With the release of the Raspberry Pi 5, previous work, along with improvements in the Pi, have allowed for more success in interfacing PCIe hardware like graphics cards - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLg-1w2QayU) and [GitHub](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/564).

## NanoPy - A New Python for Programming Microcontrollers

[![NanoPy](../assets/20231204/20231204nanopy.jpg)](https://nanopy.io/en/)

Oxon AG in Switzerland has renamed OxoPy to NanoPy and are touting it to program microcontrollers - [NanoPy](https://nanopy.io/en/).

> NanoPy is a simple and clear scripting language that both beginners and experienced users can quickly get to grips with. It is used in microcontroller projects, for example for smarthomes, educational and gaming computers or automation and robotics projects. NanoPy masters the well-known Python style or can be programmed even more simply, in a more compact form without colons and with fewer brackets.

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I was able to improve the functionality of ESP32-S3 BLE acting as a BLE central. It now can talk to simple BLE devices such as pulse oximeters.

I'm continuing to work on CircuitPython 8.2.x and 9.0.0 issues, as we head toward 9.0.0 betas and then the final release.

**Melissa**

This past week was a short one due to the holiday. I spent time catching up on messages because I had also taken some time off the week before. I updated the [Qualia S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays) with backlight information as well as adding another Arduino example.

**Tim**

This week I tested out the new addition of Arcs in the Display Shapes library, the Qualia S3 and 2.1" round display made for perfect testing grounds. I've also been continuing work on a refactor of proposed changes in circup that add support for web workflow. Over the past weekend I made progress on updating fixing my PyGame_Display library to work with the latest versions of `Blinka_DisplayIO`, there are still quirks to work out but I've gotten the display to render successfully. 

**Jeff**

The CircuitPython library for the upcoming camera product is now [public on github](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyCamera/).

There are some details to be worked out before this can be published as part of the bundle, because the autofocus camera module requires a "firmware.bin" file which we can't currently include as part of the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle. In the process of updating the bundle builder to handle this, I learned that a handful of libraries for CircuitPython, mostly in the community bundle, have incorrect data in `pyproject.toml`, which I would like to rely on to determine which files to include.

Last week I was out for family time and the Thanksgiving holiday. This week I'm mostly around so I did some bug fixing for the web workflow. First, I fixed incorrect behavior when a file that was too big is uploaded. Second, I fixed the websocket serial responsiveness to ctrl-c.

Now I'm looking at adding support for uploading directly to an attached disk (and displaying disk usage at the same time).

This week I published the [Qualia S3 Space Clock guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/qualia-s3-space-clock). This project was a fun challenge and I learned a ton. It was my first time working with a round display, I had to figure out how to calculate Mars time and I had to do some math to properly calculate the hour and minute hand positions for the clock face. Noe did an excellent job with the enclosure. We are both fans of retro futuristic designs from the 50's and 60's and I think he really captured that design aesthetic while managing to keep it easy to print and assemble for folks.
