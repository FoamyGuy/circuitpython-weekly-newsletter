## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20231204/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I was able to improve the functionality of ESP32-S3 BLE acting as a BLE central. It now can talk to simple BLE devices such as pulse oximeters.

I'm continuing to work on CircuitPython 8.2.x and 9.0.0 issues, as we head toward 9.0.0 betas and then the final release.

**Melissa**

This past week was a short one due to the holiday. I spent time catching up on messages because I had also taken some time off the week before. I updated the [Qualia S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays) with backlight information as well as adding another Arduino example.

**Tim**

This week I tested out the new addition of Arcs in the Display Shapes library, the Qualia S3 and 2.1" round display made for perfect testing grounds. I've also been continuing work on a refactor of proposed changes in circup that add support for web workflow. Over the past weekend I made progress on updating fixing my PyGame_Display library to work with the latest versions of `Blinka_DisplayIO`, there are still quirks to work out but I've gotten the display to render successfully. 

**Jeff**

The CircuitPython library for the upcoming camera product is now [public on github](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyCamera/).

There are some details to be worked out before this can be published as part of the bundle, because the autofocus camera module requires a "firmware.bin" file which we can't currently include as part of the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle. In the process of updating the bundle builder to handle this, I learned that a handful of libraries for CircuitPython, mostly in the community bundle, have incorrect data in `pyproject.toml`, which I would like to rely on to determine which files to include.

**Scott**

[![Scott](../assets/20231204/20231204scott.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

**Liz**

This week I published the [Qualia S3 Space Clock guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/qualia-s3-space-clock). This project was a fun challenge and I learned a ton. It was my first time working with a round display, I had to figure out how to calculate Mars time and I had to do some math to properly calculate the hour and minute hand positions for the clock face. Noe did an excellent job with the enclosure. We are both fans of retro futuristic designs from the 50's and 60's and I think he really captured that design aesthetic while managing to keep it easy to print and assemble for folks.

## Upcoming Events
