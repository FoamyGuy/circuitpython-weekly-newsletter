## 170,000 Users Caught in Fake PyPI Hack

[![Hack](../assets/20240401/20240401hack.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/python_package_malware/)

More than 170,000 users are said to have been affected by an attack using fake Python infrastructure. The Top.gg GitHub organization – a top resource for Discord bot makers – as well as other developers were targeted, and it all hinged on various supply chain attack techniques to distribute malware-infected Python PyPI packages. That malware stole data from people's browsers, Discord app, crypto wallets, and files that matched certain keywords. There were multiple prongs to this remarkably complicated attack: clones of popular Python packages such as Colorama, a typosquatted domain for Python packages, and code obfuscation - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/python_package_malware/).

PyPI shut down creation of new users and projects for ten hours due to security concerns for typosquatting package names - [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/pypi-halted-new-users-and-projects-while-it-fended-off-supply-chain-attack/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added:

- [ESP32-S3-GEEK](https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_esp32_s3_geek/)
- [Sunton ESP32-2432S028](https://circuitpython.org/board/sunton_esp32_2432S028/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I made bugfix releases CircuitPython 9.0.1 and 9.0.2 in quick succession this last week, and also released CircuitPython 9.1.0 Beta 0, which has some new features and has updated the version of ESP-IDF it uses, courtesy of Scott.

I'm continuing to fix bugs in 9.0.x and 9.x.x. The day I wrote this, I found out `AnalogIn` is not working properly in 9.x.x. This turns out to be a compilation issue of some kind: when compiled with gcc 10, the code works fine, but not when compiled with gcc 13. It may be a statement reordering problem. I have a hackish fix but will be trying to understand this problem in more detail.

**Melissa**

This past week was spent mostly working on GitHub issues. Some of these issues were requests for new features like adding PWM support to the Jetson Nano. Most of these were bug fixes like updating the CircuitPython installer to run on Windows computers and fixing some of the Arduino repos that were no longer passing CI (Continuous Integration) due to compilation warnings.

**Tim**

I've been updating Learn guide code and pages for new displayio API, although we've decided to change how the warnings are working so I am going back through to revert the changes I made to guide pages and we will hold off until further down the line when the backwards compatibility is removed entirely. 

I've started building out a basic Tic Tac Toe game that will get integrated into a conference badge for PyCon. Lastly, I've managed to get working some example code that loads an RSA keypair and uses `adafruit_httpserver` to receive a message encrypted in the front end with the public key and then uses `adafruit_rsa` library to decrypt it in the backend and show the plain text to the user.

I had a chance to do a project for myself using CircuitPython this week. It'll probably emerge as a Learn guide in the next month or two, but I'll spoiler it here: I made a video converter for an old Xerox 820 (8-bit CP/M computer) to HDMI using the Adafruit Feather RP2040 DVI. This is a very niche display (it is 560x240 pixels at 59Hz) but the technique might apply to other monochrome computers of the era.

In the course of doing this, I put in a Pull Request to add a 640x240 video mode to picodvi. This is a very non-square resolution, but such modes were common in old computers; for instance, CGA featured a 640x200 mode that this would allow in letterboxed fashion.

For those who may be immediately interested, I've published a version of the code as a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/jepler/cf582975546f1aa0039ed88d3a991c66).

This week I wrapped up the update to ESP-IDF 5.2. It'll be released in CircuitPython 9.1. I'm continuing work on USB host featherwing support in CircuitPython after Thach added deinit functionality to TinyUSB. Thanks Thach!

This week I worked on a [project to control Elgato key lights with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-elgato-wifi-light-controller). The Elgato lights use an app that accepts HTTP requests to control turning them on and off, brightness and color temperature. I used a Feather ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT to connect to WiFi and send the requests with the onboard buttons. I also added in a rotary encoder to dial in color temperature and brightness. This was really fun to work on and I might expand the project further if I have time by trying to use MDNS to automatically find the lights on the network.
