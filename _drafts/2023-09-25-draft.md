Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Hacktoberfest 10 Starts October 1st

[![Hacktoberfest](../assets/20230925/20230925hack.jpg)](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest! Hacktoberfest has grown from 676 participants in 2014 to nearly 147,000 participants last year - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

What is Hacktoberfest? 

> "Join forces in virtual and in-person events to get your project's pull/merge requests done as a team, learn new skills, and meet lifelong friends. This year we’re partnering with Major League Hacking to help the community connect. Open source projects, maintained by community-minded coders, make the modern internet function. Supporting that essential work, and the folks behind it, is what Hacktoberfest is all about."

As in previous years, CircuitPython will be participating in Hacktoberfest, marking some Pull Requests as Hacktober eligible. Keep an eye on the Adafruit Blog and Social Media for details as October approaches. Note the reward system is shifting from T-shirts to virtual rewards - [Hacktoberfest Rewards](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#digital-rewards).

## Making a Single-Button Keyboard With CircuitPython

[![Single-Button Keyboard](../assets/20230925/20230925button.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/modular-s-magiclick-s3-is-a-circuitpython-powered-single-button-keyboard-with-tricks-up-its-sleeve-7aa3eec95aff)

MagiClick S3 is a single-button keyboard, based on an Espressif ESP32-S3 microcontroller, with a color screen. The display part adopts a 0.85-inch color screen, 128×128 resolution. The main control board is currently designed with the ESP32-S3 which supports WiFi, flash, and RAM large enough to help add more functional scripts in CircuitPython - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/modular-s-magiclick-s3-is-a-circuitpython-powered-single-button-keyboard-with-tricks-up-its-sleeve-7aa3eec95aff), [GitHub](https://github.com/MakerM0/MagiClick-esp32s3) and the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/19/magiclick-s3-is-a-circuitpython-powered-single-button-keyboard-with-display-circuitpython-hacksterio/).

## PyScript "Next" Rewrites Browser-based Python Scripting

[![PyScript "Next"](../assets/20230925/20230925ps.jpg)](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/discussions/1744)

After a huge amount of effort, the PyScript team announces the release of the first technical preview of the [next version of PyScript](https://pyscript.net/unstable/).

This is a big change. In summary, the team writes:

* We have re-architected PyScript on top of a new core: Polyscript.
* This has significantly reduced the size of PyScript and improved its performance.
* PyScript supports multiple Python interpreters (Pyodide and MicroPython).
* PyScript now supports parallel execution of code via web workers.
* There is a new plugin system.
* We've started a complete re-write of the documentation.

Changelog: We re-wrote everything - [GitHub](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/discussions/1744).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

After several hours of "pair merging" with Jeff, we resolved all the pending merge conflicts in the MicroPython v1.20.0 merge to CircuitPython. I was then able to make the first commit to my merge branch. Jeff then got the mpy-cross executable to build after numerous small changes, and I made some further touch-ups. I'll be continuing on the merge in the coming days.

We would all like to thank Kattni for her years of work on the CircuitPython, its community, libraries, and guides. We are looking forward to seeing what she'll be doing next.

**Kattni**

My last day working with Adafruit was Friday, September 22, 2023. I want to say thank you to everyone in this community. This community is a huge part of what started this chapter in my life, and my involvement with it has been one of the most fulfilling and amazing things I’ve done over the last five years. I would not be where I am today without the support and encouragement I received from so many folks along the way. You have read my guides, helped me with code and bugs, taught me new things, and so much more. 

One of the best things has been you telling me when something I suggested, created or helped create had a positive impact on you or folks you know. Keep sharing those stories. Thank you for being amazing, thank you for being a part of the welcoming, positive, supportive place that we’ve created together, and finally, thank you for welcoming me as a community leader and giving me the opportunity to gain the experience of building an open source community.

**Melissa**

This week I continued working on going through issues in the various GitHub repos starting with Blinka. I also went through and updated the configuration and documentation settings so that everything was building properly. Eventually I moved over to working on the Blinka `Displayio` issues by updating the code to better align it with the CircuitPython `displayio` code layout and making it more readable.

**Tim**

This week I ran the RTD Theme fix patch with the Adabot Utility that applies the patch to all Libraries. It was my first time using this functionality of Adabot, I was shown how prior but had no "hands on" experience. There were a handful that it failed to push, so I also created PRs on those ones with the same fix. I also tested some changes to the Ethernet `Wiznet5k` Library, and I've been continuing work on a templating engine with a community member.

**Jeff**

I added code to the core to initialize dot clock LCD displays that require use of an I2C bus expander. This sounds pretty esoteric, but is needed in order to support the built in LCD screen on the Espressif ESP32-S3 LCD Evaluation Kit.

I'm also helping out Dan with the MicroPython 1.20 merge. We're making progress but there are a large number of errors to fix, first in the build process and then the problems that turn up during automated and manual testing. This merge is one of the things that we want to get done before the first alpha release of CircuitPython 9.

It had been months since I had time to do a keyboard conversion guide. That changed this past week when I took a couple of hours to write up a conversion of the Unicomp "Mini M" tenkeyless keyboard to use CircuitPython. You can find it on the [learn playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/jepler/pages/unicomp-micro-m-with-circuitpython). This buckling spring keyboard was recently updated with a Raspberry Pi Pico as the controller, which makes putting CircuitPython easy, if you don't mind potentially voiding your warranty by opening up the enclosure.

**Scott**

Last week I finished up the Espressif IDF 5.0 update for CircuitPython and [made a PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8411). I also [started the 5.1 merge during my stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/VsuwSUXU9q0?si=_F7I8HPU9njNqr6q&t=2621). More changes were needed this week to enable ESP32-C6 support but it is working now. Code size is still an issue unfortunately. The 5.1 update should come pretty quickly after 5.0.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the Adafruit Learning System guide for the [LED Matrix Sports Scoreboard](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-matrix-sports-scoreboard). This project uses four 64x32 RGB LED matrices with the Matrix Portal S3 to fetch data from the ESPN API for various sports and leagues. I took the hero shots while the New England Patriots were playing against the Miami Dolphins and, although they ultimately lost to the Dolphins, it was fun to see the data update alongside the live feed.
