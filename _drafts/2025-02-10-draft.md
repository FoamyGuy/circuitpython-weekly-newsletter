## Adafruit Announces Fruit Jam, an RP2350B-based Single Board Computer

[![Fruit Jam](../assets/20250210/20250210fruitjam.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/02/03/fruit-jam-rp2350b-credit-card-mini-computer-with-all-the-fixins/)

Looking to "jam a ridonkulous amount of hardware" into a single-board computer, Adafruit has shown their design in progress, initially entitled Fruit Jam. Adafruit is aiming it for classic game and computer emulation and CircuitPython, although it should work with any RP2350 compatible language - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/02/03/fruit-jam-rp2350b-credit-card-mini-computer-with-all-the-fixins/), [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/adafruit-unveils-a-work-in-progress-raspberry-pi-rp2350b-single-board-computer-the-fruit-jam-008f4cc73dde), and [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/adafruits-fruit-jam-is-a-raspberry-pi-pico-2-powered-credit-card-sized-computer).

> "With the extra pins of the QFN-80 RP2350B, we’re able to jam a ridonkulous amount of hardware into this shape: RP2350B dual 150MHz Cortex M33 w/ PicoProbe debug port, 16 MB Flash + 8 MB PSRAM, USB type C for bootloading/USB client, Micro SD card with SPI or SDIO, DVI output on the HSTX port, I2S stereo headphone + mono speaker via the TLV320DAC3100, 2-port USB type A hub for both keyboard and mouse or game controllers, chunky on-off switch, Stemma QT I2C + Stemma classic JST 3-pin, EYESPI for TFT displays, 5x NeoPixels, 3x tactile switches, and a 16-pin socket header with 10 A/D GPIO + 5V/3V/GND power pins. The PSRAM will help when we want to do things like run emulations that we need to store in fast RAM access, and it will also let us use the main SRAM as the DVI video buffer."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20250210/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I am working on the NINA-FW firmware, which is used in Adafruit's AirLift breakouts and co-processors. A pull request to update NINA-FW from its upstream repo has been stalled for a while, but I believe I am now making progress on finishing the update.

**Tim**

This week I worked on examples and a Learn guide for using RGB matrix panels with the Raspberry Pi 5 using the new PioMatter library that Jeff wrote. After that I started working on the GC9A01A display. I've adapted a 3rd party driver for the latest versions of CircuitPython and added it to the bundle. I've got another project lined up that will make use of this display.

**Jeff**

My last week saw more PIO activity. I fixed a regression in `rp2pio` that affected `RotaryEncoder` on RP2040/RP2350 when more than one encoder is in use. This is merged into CircuitPython and will appear in an upcoming release. Relatedly, I also worked on allowing multiple rotary encoders on Pi 5. This work has not yet reached the stage of being PR'd.

Another thing I'm working on is automatically connecting to an attached display on boards like Feather RP2350 with the HSTX connector. When this code is added, boards that enable it will check for the presence of an I2C EEPROM at address 0x50, which holds the monitor's EDID information and enable a framebuffer when it's found. At the time of writing, this work is in a draft PR and will undergo some improvements before it's merged.

**Scott**

This past week I've polished up my Zephyr work and [submitted a pull request (PR) for review](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10026). It is still a work in progress but gives folks a chance to test it and expand it. I took a little detour to update our Python code formatting to `ruff` from `black` too. This matches what MicroPython does. Next up I'm circling back to WiFi within Zephyr.

**Liz**

Thanks to Tim now assisting with product guides, I finally had time to work on the guide and CircuitPython driver for the [INA228](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ina228-i2c-power-monitor). This breakout lets you monitor high or low side power measurements over I2C. There is support in both Arduino and CircuitPython, so you can easily add detailed power monitoring to your projects.

## Upcoming Events
