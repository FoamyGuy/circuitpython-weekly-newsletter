## Project of the Week: Bringing Fiter Jet Joysticks to Life with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython

[![Bringing Fiter Jet Joysticks to Life](../assets/20240930/20240930potw.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-brings-junked-joysticks-back-to-life-the-magpi-146/)

The MagPi Issue 146 documents an amazing reverse engineering. A pair of military fighter jet joysticks were obtained by Andrew Gregory at EMF Camp. Finding they used RS-232, their protocol was reverse engineered and fed into a Raspberry Pi Pico running CircuitPuthon as a custom USB HID (Human Interface Device) to feed into a computer so the joystick can be used in flight simulators - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-brings-junked-joysticks-back-to-life-the-magpi-146/).
