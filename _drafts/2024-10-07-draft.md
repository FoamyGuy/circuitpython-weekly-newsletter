## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241007/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

Last week, I finished updating CircuitPython to use the new Espressif ESP-IDF I2C driver, and solved a problem with the `esp32-camera` library which had also been updated to use the new driver.

This week I'm continuing to work on the remaining issues for CircuitPython 9.2.0 final.

**Tim**

This week I worked on some changes to the way that adabot's actions that built the CircuitPython bundles work in order to make it not commit and push the results if the bundle build was not successful. In doing so it also came to light that a recent change to the way GitHub returns headers in some of their API responses caused a different issue for parts of adabot. I dug into the differing headers and GitHub documentation to understand the issue.

**Jeff**

After finishing up all my testing of the RP2350 (no terrible bugs found!) I also made a little countdown clock project, which I [posted on the Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/jepler/pages/e-ink-countdown-in-circuitpython-with-custom-stand).

**Scott**

This last week I've continued through the Matter commissioning steps. I'm *very* close to completing the process. I assume the following step will be implementing the device type. My wife and I are expecting our second child in the next few weeks so we'll see how far I can get before then.

**Liz**

This week I worked on another [guide for using itsaSNAP](https://learn.adafruit.com/use-apple-homekit-devices-with-itsasnap). This time I used Matter devices in Apple HomeKit to use Adafruit IO to read and write data to them. I also wrote a CircuitPython example using a Feather ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT to display the data and control a light strip with the onboard buttons. I'm really loving using itsaSNAP and highly recommend folks experiment it.
