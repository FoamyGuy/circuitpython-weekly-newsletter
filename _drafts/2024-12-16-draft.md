Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Lots of news this week as everyone is getting things in before the holidays. A scheduling note: Next week (December 23rd) will be an end-of-year wrap-up edition and then the newsletter will be off with the next issue being January 13th as folks get back to their activities (and this will provide me with a holiday break). I hope you like this issue as I've gone in-depth finding information on some of the cool stuff happening. Cheers! - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## The Raspberry Pi 500 Keyboard Debuts Along With an HDMI Monitor

[![Raspberry Pi 500 Keyboard Debuts](../assets/20241216/20241216pi500.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-500-and-raspberry-pi-monitor-on-sale-now/)

Raspberry Pi has released two hotly anticipated products: the [Raspberry Pi 500](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6111) keyboard sized computer, available for $90, and the [Raspberry Pi Monitor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6088) for $100 - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-500-and-raspberry-pi-monitor-on-sale-now/).

[![Inside the Pi 500](../assets/20241216/20241216pi500b.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/pi-500-much-faster-lacks-m2)

Jeff Geerling does a thorough review of the Pi 500. He notes the PCB has space for a PCIe card and power over Ethernet, but the components are not placed, therefore the unit dooesn't have those capabilities (but may in the future in a "pro" model). Overall it's a solid offering, with the 2x to 3x speedup from the Pi 5 design - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/pi-500-much-faster-lacks-m2) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5YfJWYELA3k).

[![Pi Monitor](../assets/20241216/20241216pi500c.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/pi-500-much-faster-lacks-m2)

The monitor is a 15.6" IPS LCD with speakers. It can be powered either directly off the Pi's USB port (at 60% brightness and 60% volume), or via an external USB-C charger (for 100%). It comes with an integrated kickstand. If the VESA mount is used, it does block the ports, making changing connections difficult - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/pi-500-much-faster-lacks-m2).

[![Adafruit Visits Boston College](../assets/20241216/20241216bc2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/11/visiting-the-student-tech-showcase-at-boston-college-2024/)

On Friday, December 6th, Adafruiters Noe and Liz visited Boston College (BC) for Professor John Gallaugher‘s Student Tech Showcase, joined by BC alum and maker Guy Dupont - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/11/visiting-the-student-tech-showcase-at-boston-college-2024/).

> "At the end of every semester, Prof. Gallaugher organizes a showcase for his students in his physical computing and Swift programming classes to present their end of semester projects science fair-style. All of the projects were very impressive. For most of the students, the class had marked the first time they were working with these technologies, including electronics for the physical computing students.
<br>&nbsp; <br>
Prof. Gallaugher uses [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) and a lot of [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) hardware in his physical computing course. We were able to chat with the students presenting to learn about their projects and hear about their experiences using CircuitPython and Adafruit hardware."

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241216/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **507**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've been working on making the CircuitMatter library run under CircuitPython. Currently, in regular Python, CircuitMatter relies on several other libraries, and uses features of Python that are not available in CircuitPython. I've been preparing trimmed-down and substitute versions of the prerequisite libraries, and changing the code so it can be run in CircuitPython.

**Tim**

I've been continuing to work on issues in library repos, this week I received various sensors for testing different fixes. I also made a CircuitPython implementation of Karel the Robot, a utility for learning the basics of programming. I'm starting to experiment with wiz connected smart lights to interface with them from CircuitPython.

**Jeff**

I've been working on Raspberry Pi 5 NeoPixel support in Adafruit Blinka. By the time you read this, it's likely that (after a few simple steps like updating your Pi's kernel & firmware to the latest official versions) `import neopixel` will work on Raspberry Pi 5 computers with Blinka installed on them.

**Scott**

I've been continuing to work on CircuitPython on Zephyr. `west flash` worked well to load the new binary onto the nRF52840 and it started up! I got output over the serial to the UART adapter. I tried connecting CircuitPython to the Zephyr console but discovered it is blocking! So, CircuitPython starts up and then just waits for a character forever. Next, I'll use a lower level asynchronous API. I'm travelling this week though and then mostly off for holidays so I'm not sure when that'll happen. Follow along on my [Zephyr git branch](https://github.com/tannewt/circuitpython/tree/zephyr).

**Liz**

This past week I had the opportunity to visit Boston College (BC) for Professor John Gallaugher's Student Tech Showcase. At the end of every semester, Prof. Gallaugher organizes a showcase for his students in his physical computing and Swift programming classes to present their end of semester projects science fair-style. The students use CircuitPython and a lot of Adafruit hardware in his physical computing course. I wrote up a [blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/11/visiting-the-student-tech-showcase-at-boston-college-2024/) detailing the visit and highlighting some of the CircuitPython projects that were on display; all of which were very impressive, especially for only one semester of work.

## Upcoming Events
