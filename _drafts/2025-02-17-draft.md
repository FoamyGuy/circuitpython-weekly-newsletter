Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Happy belated Valentine's Day. This week we start with comparing Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython and then compare the processing power of various Raspberry Pi single board computers over the years. And further on an article on why you might want to use a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller instead of a full Pi. There are more events you'll want to check out and so much more in this packed issue. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

With the help of testers from the community, I made a version of NINA-FW that includes updates from the upstream Arduino version. It now works with ECDSA certificates chains, which was a long-standing issue. A little more testing is in progress with version 2.0.0-rc.0+adafruit. Assuming that works out I will release 2.0.0+adafruit soon. The "+adafruit" suffix is to distinguish it from the Arduino version.

**Tim**

This week I worked on updating the Raspberry Pi 5 RGB Matrix examples to make use of the latest API, and wrote a new guide page that details the possible configuration options that it provides. I also finished working on a guide that features the new round displays showing an analog clock with graphics and jingles inspired by an iconic old public domain cartoon.

**Jeff**

In CircuitPython, I've been working on some quality-of-life improvements for the Raspberry Pi RP2350 microcontroller.

First up, I noticed that a display connected to my Feather RP2350 would blank when I was writing to the CIRCUITPY drive. With help from Scott & eightycc, I found a solution that involved giving the display code an elevated interrupt priority so it could run during this time, and the glitches are solved. This pull request was recently merged and is in the absolute latest releases.

Second, I've added code on select RP2350 boards (Metro RP2350 and Feather RP2350) to detect an attached display via the presence of the "EDID" chip in the monitor. If the monitor is there, the display will be configured, by default to 320x240 with 16 bits per pixel. In the same pull request, I changed how `board.DISPLAY` works: Now all boards with displayio will have a `board.DISPLAY` property which always reflects a configured display, and which is `None` if there's no configured display. This also makes it easier for a display configured in `boot.py` or in a previous run of `code.py` to be used the next time without the need to reconfigure it. As I write this, the pull request is waiting for approval. In the future, the monitor auto-detection might be applied to other boards.

I also did some behind-the-scenes changes, saving some space in the flash chips by removing redundant routines in the CircuitPython source without affecting any functionality (hopefully). One pull request has been merged, and another is pending.

**Scott**

This week I was continuing on Zephyr WiFi work. I managed to connect to my WiFi and get an IP address. Next work is to get socket stuff going. **However**, I got my Fruit Jam board and I'm working on board bring up. I added support for 720x400 video output for better widescreen support. Now I'm debugging USB Host support.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [240x240 Round Display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-28-240x240-round-tft-lcd). This display uses the GC9A01A driver. I had to add support for this driver to the RGB Display library to have it work with Blinka. This support has been merged in so it is ready for folks to use. There are examples in the guide for CircuitPython, Python and Arduino.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20250217/20250217weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
