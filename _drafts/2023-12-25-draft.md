## The CircuitPython Blinka Python Compatibility Layer Updates libgpiod and More

[![Blinka Compatibility Layer](../assets/20231225/20231225blinka.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/releases/tag/8.28.0)

The CircuitPython Blinka Python compatibility layer, supporting SBCs, has been updated for better support of Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO and more - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/releases/tag/8.28.0).

For more on Blinka – [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/blinka), [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka).

## Linux at Thirty-two

[![Linux at Thirty-two](../assets/20231225/20231225linux.jpg)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3711723/thirty-two-years-of-linux-and-its-community.html)

Linus Torvalds has been working on Linux for 32 years, longer than many software developers have been alive. Surprisingly though, Linux, Torvalds’ earliest “hobby project,” arguably gains in importance each year, despite its age. In the case of Linux, its ongoing relevance isn’t an accident. Instead, it’s a testament to some key lessons Torvalds has learned and applied for years. He [shared some of those lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvuEYtkOH88&t=6s) at the recent Open Source Summit in Japan - [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3711723/thirty-two-years-of-linux-and-its-community.html).

## A Review of the Pineberry Pi Raspberry Pi 5 M.2 NVME SSD HAT

[![Pineberry Pi Raspberry Pi 5 M.2 NVME SSD HAT](../assets/20231225/20231225hat.jpg)](https://bret.dk/pineberry-pi-hatdrive-review-raspberry-pi-5-m-2-hat/)

Pineberry Pi is a Polish company founded in September 2023 with the goal of creating incredibly useful hardware to support Raspberry Pi Single Board Computers (SBC). They've developed two versions of a M.2 NVME SSD storage HAT, one mounted on top of a Pi 5 and one that is mounted below the Pi. bret.dk kicks the tires and provides a detailed review of the boards - [bret.dk](https://bret.dk/pineberry-pi-hatdrive-review-raspberry-pi-5-m-2-hat/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was one new board added:

- [Raspberry Breadstick](https://circuitpython.org/board/breadstick_raspberry/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20231225/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

This past week I released NINA-FW 1.7.7 to update the latest roots certificate list. This firmware is not CircuitPython, but is the WiFi/BLE firmware used on AirLift boards. There are still issues with certain TLS/SSL certificates which we are working to understand.

I added checking to reject BMP files for **OnDiskBitmap** that are run-length-encoded (RLE). Previously we didn’t check for this, and as a result they displayed as garbage. This fix will show up in the next 8.2.x stable release and 9.0.0 development release. The fix was easy but it pushed one board over the firmware storage limit for a large translation. I was able to consolidate and refactor a number of error messages to reduce the firmware size enough to be able to fit.

**Tim**

This week I worked on fixing the tests run by the circup repo actions to work with the refactored version of the library in the proposed web workflow PR branch. I've also been working on adding pixel location to cell coordinate helpers to the GridLayout helper class. This functionality can be used to make a soft keyboard with displayio and touch screens.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20231225/20231225jeff.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I'm excited to announce the launch of a new bundle called [circuitpython-fonts](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-fonts). With `circuitpython-fonts`, you have 75 fonts in 14 different sizes at your disposal, each easy to install with [circup](https://pypi.org/project/circup/) or manually by copying a folder to your CIRCUITPY drive. Above are just a few of them at 72 pixels on an Adafruit Qualia with the 320x820 bar display.

**Liz**

[![Liz](../assets/20231225/20231225liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I've been working on documenting two new products in the shop before the holidays. The [USB Host FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-usb-host-featherwing-with-max3421e) uses a MAX3421E USB host chip so that you can easily add USB host support to your project. The TinyUSB Arduino library has native interface for host support for all TinyUSB supported chips. I included a few of the examples from the library in the guide and tested with multiple Feathers.

The second guide is for the MEMENTO camera board. There are a ton of features on this board and taking photos with it while documenting has been really fun. Although standalone digital cameras and cell phone cameras have been common for most of my life, I still remember when they were new and too expensive for my teenage budget so it's pretty incredible to now have that capability in a hackable dev board.

I'm going to be taking the next two weeks off to recharge for 2024. I look forward to more great projects in the New Year.
