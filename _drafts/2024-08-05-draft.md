## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240805/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've done all the file merging and reviewing for the merging of MicroPython v1.22 into CircuitPython. I submitted a draft PR and fixed some minor errors that caused parts of the build to fail. Now I need to examine and fix the errors that are appearing when the tests are run. But there aren't many and I hope to finish the merge soon.

**Melissa**

**Tim**

This week I tested some changes that add backwards compatibility to Blinka DisplayIO on a Raspberry Pi. I've also been continuing move libraries over to use Ruff instead of Black and PyLint as I'm looking into them to review PRs. The other thing I did was looking into RTD builds to try to confirm a new fix for an issue that resulted in the board module documentation page being blank.

**Scott**

This last week I've continued work on CircuitMatter. I've successfully established a passcode based secure channel and decrypted the next message sent over it. It is part of the "interaction model" layer of Matter so I'm laying more groundwork for how that layer will work. I suspect it is the same layer that user code will interact with from within Python/CircuitPython.

**Liz**

This week I worked on code for the [CNC Rotary Macropad guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/cnc-rotary-macropad). This project is a collab with the Ruiz brothers and uses a Feather RP2040 with ortho snap apart NeoKeys and a chonky CNC rotary encoder. I wrote the code to be easily customizable for folks so that they could change the shortcuts if they wanted to.
