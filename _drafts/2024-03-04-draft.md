## Raspberry Pi Celebrates 12 Years

[![Raspberry Pi Turns 12](../assets/20240304/20240304pi.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/you-cant-eat-our-birthday-cake-because-it-is-full-of-leds/)

Happy Birthday to Raspberry Pi on 29 February. They're a leap-year baby, technically it's their third birthday. They've sold 61 million units as of their anniversary. They celebrated by having their in-house maker Toby whip up projects with Raspberry Pi Pico W, NeoPixel LEDs and MicroPython - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/you-cant-eat-our-birthday-cake-because-it-is-full-of-leds/), [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-celebrates-12-years-as-sales-break-61-million-units) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/29/happy-12th-birthday-raspberry-pi-or-is-it-a-3rd-birthday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've been fixing nRF- and MEMENTO-related bugs for the 9.0.0 release. Then I'll move on to whatever remaining bugs there are.

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on writing a guide on some of the new features of Web Workflow, but unfortunately ran into a bug in CircuitPython that stopped me from finishing up the guide. Once the bug is resolved, I'll be able to finish up. In the interim, I switched over to fixing some Raspberry Pi related bugs including updating the Blinka installer and PiTFT installer script to fix a couple of issues so they are now backwards compatible with Bullseye.

**Tim**

I did library PR reviews across several libraries. I've also been working on applying changes from feedback on the web workflow support for circup. The workflow APIs have changed slightly, so it needed some catching up an addition to the feedback from prior review. I'm trying to dig into circup for a different issue that was noticed as well that is resulting in it not wanting to install the new ConnectionManager library based on its PyPI name. 

**Jeff**

I'm excited to be on the talk schedule at PyCon US 2024! I'll be giving a talk titled "Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs" on May 19 in Pittsburgh, PA.

**Scott**

Last week I was fixing two USB host related issues we wanted to fix before 9.0 release. This week I've been out most of the week with a sick kid at home. Once I'm back to work, I'll continue fixing 9.0.0 issues so that we can release another major stable version.

**Liz**

This week I published the [BLE Cat Thermal Printer with MEMENTO guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-cat-thermal-printer-with-memento). This guide goes through connecting the MEMENTO camera to print photos on the BLE cat thermal printer with a gameboy photo filter. This was really fun to work on and I especially enjoyed writing the guide copy on the overview page.

I also wrapped up the product guide for the new [ItsyBitsy ESP32](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-esp32). You can run CircuitPython on this board with web workflow and I wrote a few example pages stepping thru the process for downloading the project bundle and uploading the libraries and code thru the browser. I hope these steps will help folks new to web workflow get the hang of it.
