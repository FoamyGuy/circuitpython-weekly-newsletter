Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython Comes to the ESP32-P4 Evaluation Board

[![CircuitPython Comes to the ESP32-P4 Evaluation Board](../assets/20240916/20240916p4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGEw1Hig0Q&t=2s)

Core CircuitPython developer Scott has been chugging away at adding ESP32-P4 support to CircuitPython. He has provided Ladyada a bin file that runs on the Eval board received last week from Espressif. Native USB is still in progress, but she could connect to the REPL and save files using the USB-Serial converter. "It's so fast at 400mhz, and with 16 or 32 MHz of PSRAM, it's going to be an awesome board for embedded Python" - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/10/esp32-p4-booting-up-and-running-circuitpython/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGEw1Hig0Q&t=2s).

## RP2350: the Brains of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2

[![RP2350: the brains of Raspberry Pi Pico 2](../assets/20240916/20240916rp.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/rp2350-the-brains-of-raspberry-pi-pico-2/)

Nick Francis, technical director at Raspberry Pi, writes about the features of the new RP2350 and how it was designed. An interesting note - it appears all Raspberry Pi microcontroller chips are made on the TSMC 40nm process - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/rp2350-the-brains-of-raspberry-pi-pico-2/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240916/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!
