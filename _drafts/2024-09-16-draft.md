Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## CircuitPython Comes to the ESP32-P4 Evaluation Board

[![CircuitPython Comes to the ESP32-P4 Evaluation Board](../assets/20240916/20240916p4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGEw1Hig0Q&t=2s)

Core CircuitPython developer Scott has been chugging away at adding ESP32-P4 support to CircuitPython. He has provided Ladyada a bin file that runs on the Eval board received last week from Espressif. Native USB is still in progress, but she could connect to the REPL and save files using the USB-Serial converter. "It's so fast at 400mhz, and with 16 or 32 MHz of PSRAM, it's going to be an awesome board for embedded Python" - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/10/esp32-p4-booting-up-and-running-circuitpython/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGEw1Hig0Q&t=2s).

## Armulet allows Raspberry Pi to run Arm code on RISC-V

[![Armulet allows Raspberry Pi to run Arm code on RISC-V](../assets/20240916/20240916arm.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/10/armulet-allows-raspberry-pi-to-run-arm-code-on-risc-v/)

ARMULET is a C ARMv6M / ARMv8M-baseline emulator by Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is using Armulet to run Arm code on RISC-V in the RP2350 bootrom. The effort could be augmented to run legacy Arm code on a RISC-V only architecture - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/10/armulet-allows-raspberry-pi-to-run-arm-code-on-risc-v/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/armulet).

Per the RP2350 bootrom details:

> "Because of limited space, we cannot duplicate a lot of code in RISC-V, so ARM code is emulated (varmulet) on RISC-V. We emulate (roughly) Arm8-M Baseline not Arm8-M Mainline as it has many fewer less complex instructions (Arm8-M Baseline adds a small number of, but very handy instructions over m0-plus)."

## Python 3.13.0RC2, 3.12.6, 3.11.10, 3.10.15, 3.9.20, and 3.8.20 Are Now Available

Nick Francis, technical director at Raspberry Pi, writes about the features of the new RP2350 and how it was designed. An interesting note - it appears all Raspberry Pi microcontroller chips are made on the TSMC 40nm process - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/rp2350-the-brains-of-raspberry-pi-pico-2/).

## Stretching the Possibilities of Soft Robots with Flexible Electronics

[![Stretching the possibilities of soft robots with flexible electronics](../assets/20240916/20240916stretch.jpg)](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-09-possibilities-soft-robots-flexible-electronics.html)

Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio and a team of researchers have developed complex electronics that can stretch substantially beyond their original shape. Further, the system can be easily adapted to different uses. [The results](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844) of their work are published in Science Robotics. As a demonstration, they developed stretchable versions of an Arduino — a widely used open-sourced electronics platform—and embedded them into soft robots - [RechXplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-09-possibilities-soft-robots-flexible-electronics.html).

The Raspberry Pi 5 packs quite a powerful computational punch for its low price point and compact size. That's far from the only thing about the Raspberry Pi that has been changed for the newest model, though. SlashGear takes a look at some of the low-key features, upgrades, and beneficiaries of those features and upgrades that help it stand out - [SlashGear](https://www.slashgear.com/1655856/underrated-features-upgrades-raspberry-pi-5/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

There were no new boards added this week, but several are in process.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

This week I wrapped up the implementation of serial plotter inside the CircuitPython Web IDE. It's now available in the beta version of the IDE page. I also wrote up the guide for my latest project: a cardboard arcade game inspired by Simon.

**Jeff**

I'm continuing to work on support for the new PIO peripheral features in the RP2350. Right at the moment I'm adding support for the "txput" and "txget" modes, which allow access to 4 32-bit numbers in random access fashion, instead of in FIFO fashion. There aren't yet any PIO programs I've found that use these features, but I want to add it for completeness.

**Scott**

This week I've been debugging I2C on Espressif chips. I updated the ESP IDF to 5.3.1 in hopes it fixes the bug. I'm not sure it did. It is a bit hard to reproduce reliably. The IDF 5.3 also adds initial support for the ESP32-P4. I received a P4 development board and polished up changes by @bwhitman to get CircuitPython running on it. USB support isn't upstreamed to TinyUSB yet so it works over serial for now.

**Liz**

I had Covid for the first time, so I was out for a bit. I'm back this week though with two new guides. The first is a [project that uses BLE on an ESP32-S3](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-ble-rs232-controller) with one of the new RS232 breakouts. I’m using the Bluefruit Connect app to send RS232 messages. The RS232 device that I used is an HDMI switcher, but you can update the CircuitPython code to send any RS232 messages that you want.

I also wrapped up the guide on the [QT Py CH32V203](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-ch32v203). This is a tiny but mighty board that has a lot of power at a low price. Huge thanks to Thach for putting in a lot of work to TinyUSB and the WCH Arduino board support package to make using the board a lot easier. He also assisted me with troubleshooting my own toolchain setup which I really appreciated.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240916/20240916weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
