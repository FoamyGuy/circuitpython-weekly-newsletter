## Why Beginning Developers Love Python

[![Why Beginning Developers Love Python](../assets/20241111/20241111love.jpg)](https://thenewstack.io/why-beginning-developers-love-python/)

Recently, [Deb Nicholson](https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/) of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/), talked about the popularity of the language, the open source community and more in an episode of The New Stack Makers - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/why-beginning-developers-love-python/l) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JK5i_FV1C3A?feature=shared).

> “It’s a great language for folks that want to learn how to code but aren’t sure what …  to do with it yet. And so you’re not as stuck as you are in some of the other languages that are more purpose-built for specific kinds of uses.”

## New Raspberry Pi Display and USB Hub

[![New Raspberry Pi Display and USB Hub](../assets/20241111/20241111piprod.jpg)](url)

Raspberry Pi has added two more products in the last week. The [Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-on-sale-now-at-60/) replaces the original display introduced back in 2015 with a resolution increase to 1280x720 pixels. And the new [Raspberry Pi USB 3 Hub](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-usb-3-hub-on-sale-now-at-12/) can help when lots of USB devices must be shared on Pi single board computers (SBC).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-blinka)

## New Learn Guides

[![New Learn Guides](../assets/20241111/20241111learn.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest)

The Adafruit Learning System has over 3,000 free guides for learning skills and building projects including using Python.

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241111/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've been working on CircuitMatter, getting it to run on CircuitPython instead of CPython (regular Python). I have a small sample program, which acts as an "OnOff" device, such as a light bulb. I simply try to run it and, see what errors I get, and then fix them. After some simple fixes, I am now running into missing cryptography libraries that are not available in CircuitPython. I will find code I can use for them or implement them, as needed.

**Tim**

I finished up the Custom LED Animations guide and it was published this week. I worked on modifications inside of Adabot to remove the pypi installs from our weekly meeting stats, and to add counts for the Adafruit and Community bundles. I've also been going through open issues in CircuitPython libraries cleaning up where applicable and trying to resolve any that are within my means without being a huge time sink. 

I've added timeouts to some sensor drivers that could block forever, and improved documentation in a few, based on info from the issues. Lastly I updated the drivers.rst file in the library bundle to include the import names for each module in addition to their title counterparts. 

**Jeff**

I've been working on smaller items, like a check at build time for a known good GCC version.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [NFC Raspberry Pi Media Player project](https://learn.adafruit.com/nfc-raspberry-pi-media-player). This project was fairly complicated because it not only involved writing code but also configuring the file system to use the M.2 HAT+ with an NVME drive. There is a lot of scattered documentation on this, mainly in Raspberry Pi forum posts with people reporting difficulties, so I'm glad I was able to document it in a guide to hopefully save people time and frustration. 

On the Python side of things, I really like the script I wrote to have a bouncing Blinka splash screen while waiting for an NFC card and the script for adding a new card and movie to the CSV file.

## Upcoming Events

[![PyCon AU](../assets/20241111/20241111pau.jpg)](https://2024.pycon.org.au/)

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20241111/20241111weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
