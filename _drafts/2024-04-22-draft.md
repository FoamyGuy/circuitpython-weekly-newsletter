## Linus Torvalds reiterates his tabs-versus-spaces stance with a kernel trap

[![Linus Torvalds reiterates his tabs-versus-spaces stance](../assets/20240422/20240422tab.jpg)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/)

A Linux commit last week changed exactly one thing on one line, replacing a tab character with a space: "It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error." Linus Torvalds responded with a commit of his own, which would "add some hidden tabs on purpose." - [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/).

## New

[![ESP32-H4 low-power dual-core RISC-V SoC](../assets/20240422/20240422h4.jpg)](https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/04/15/esp32-h4-low-power-risc-v-soc-802-15-4-bluetooth-5-4-le/)

Espressif Systems has formally announced the ESP32-H4 low-power dual-core 32-bit RISC-V wireless microcontroller with support for 802.15.4 and Bluetooth 5.4 LE portfolio after having unveiled it at CES 2024. It’s the first Espressif chip to support Bluetooth 5.4 LE with previous models such as [ESP32-H2](https://www.cnx-software.com/2021/08/03/esp32-h2-risc-v-wisoc-announced-with-zigbee-3-thread-and-bluetooth-le-5-2/) or [ESP32-C6](https://www.cnx-software.com/2023/01/12/esp32-c6-wifi-6-ble-802-15-4-module-development-board/) only supporting Bluetooth 5.0/5.2. Besides BLE 5.4 support, the new ESP32-H4 dual-core RISC-V WiSoC is an evolution of the ESP32-H2 single-core chip with PSRAM support (up to 4MB built-in), additional GPIOs (36 vs 24), touch sensing GPIOs, and some extra security features such as a power glitch detector also found in the recently announced [ESP32-C61](https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/01/10/esp32-c61-wifi-6-soc-improved-affordability-wireless-connectivity/) - [CNX Software](https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/04/15/esp32-h4-low-power-risc-v-soc-802-15-4-bluetooth-5-4-le/).

[![Geniatech XPI-3566-ZERO](../assets/20240422/20240422new2.jpg)](https://bret.dk/geniatech-xpi-3566-zero-review/)

The Geniatech XPI-3566-ZERO is another Raspberry Pi Zero form-factor SBC, though like many other Raspberry Pi alternatives, it packs in additional features and horsepower. Curiously, it also does away with others such as the microSD card slot - [bret.dk](https://bret.dk/geniatech-xpi-3566-zero-review/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240422/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.4 this past week. CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.1 will probably be released in a few days. I'm continuing to work on 9.x.x issues so we can get 9.1.0 final out.

The sphinx Python documentation system received a minor version update a few days ago. This caused two different issues with our automated build jobs that were not hard to fix: one file was slightly renamed (an underscore instead of a dash), and a new warning appeared, which made the ReadTheDocs build fail. This is the kind of maintenance which we expect to do, and yet the actual issues appear unexpectedly.

**Melissa**

This past week, I continued working on addressing feedback and updating guides. The biggest guide I updated was the [Robotic AI Bear using ChatGPT](https://learn.adafruit.com/robotic-ai-bear-using-chatgpt) guide. I also fixed an issue with the MiniPiTFT not working correctly on the Raspberry Pi Zero W.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a few product guides. There are two analog matrix switch breakouts in the shop and I wrote a quick [CircuitPython driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ADG72x) for interfacing with them. These switches let you route analog signals easily and I'd like to experiment with building a mixer with one. The other product guide I worked on was for the [STEMMA IR remote receiver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-infrared-ir-remote-receiver). This breakout makes it easy to read incoming IR signals from an IR remote, making it great for IR remote projects or recording commercial IR remote commands.
