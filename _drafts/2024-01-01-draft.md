Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We welcome 2024 as a wonderous year for Python on Hardware. New versions of CircuitPython and MicroPython are being worked on now and new Raspberry Pi hardware has invigorated single board computers. May everyone have a joyful New Year. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Arduino Exploring Manufacturing in India to Limit Counterfeit Sales

[![Arduino Exploring Manufacturing in India](../assets/20240101/20240101arduino.jpg)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/arduino-india-manufacturing/)

Arduino is considering manufacturing in India. The company, best known for its open source microcontroller boards, hopes to restrict the rise of counterfeit boards and cater to the growing demand from India’s youth population.

The Italian firm is currently exploring partnerships with electronic manufacturing service (EMS) companies in the South Asian nation to begin its local production by as early as the first quarter of next year, CEO Fabio Violante told TechCrunch in a virtual interview. This marks a substantial shift from the company’s practice of producing all its boards in Italy.

> “It is a challenge, because we are open source and make money from selling the original hardware,” he noted. “So, the clones and counterfeits are a big chunk of the market.”

Arduino is looking to address the problem of fake boards globally by making its hardware more sophisticated, which makes it more difficult to counterfeit - [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/arduino-india-manufacturing/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

It's been a quiet week. I am looking at 9.0.0 issues, and also doing some additional support work to cover for people who are out for the holidays.

**Melissa**

This past week I've working on fixing scripts that broke when the new Raspberry Pi OS came out. I've also been fixing Raspberry Pi 5 related issues.

**Tim**

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240101/20240101jeff.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I made some improvements to the `jpegio` module. It's now possible to read a jpeg file from a file or even from an `adafruit_requests` response object! You can see sample code within the [Pull Request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8723) -- this will be in the next version 9 alpha, whenever it comes out.
