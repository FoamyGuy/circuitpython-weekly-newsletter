## Limor "Ladyada" Fried Interviewed on The Pi Cast

[![Limor "Ladyada" Fried Interviewed on The Pi Cast](../assets/20230918/20230918cast.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwBl_HNvJk)

The Tom's Hardware Pi Cast on September 12th featured Limor "Ladyada" Fried from Adafruit. They discuss "Writing Arduino Drivers With AI" - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwBl_HNvJk).

> Writing libraries to support our favorite microcontrollers is a big task, but what if ChatGPT could lend a hand? Adafruit's own Limor "Ladyada" Fried has tasked ChatGPT to write Arduino drivers in her own style, creating a "mini-Limor" bot to handle the task. We sat down with Fried to talk about how AI can help Adafruit and the wider community to write drivers, and improve workflows.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.6 last Tuesday, to add a new root TLS root certificate to the roots certificate we use in the Espressif and Pico W ports. The certificate changes in 8.2.5 updated the list, but did not include a special certificate needed by webservers that use Let's Encrypt certificates.

After the release, I did some debugging with colleagues of a couple of issues that turned out to be hardware rather than software related. Now I'm back working on the MicroPython v1.20.0 merge.

**Kattni**

This week I worked on the Metro M7 with microSD guide. It has everything you need to get started with your fancy new Metro. Check it out in the Adafruit Learn System.

On a personal note, I have some news to share. My last day with Adafruit will be September 22, 2023. I will get into this more next week, but I wanted to include it along side the rest of the announcements. Thank you for being such an amazing community! You are what drew me to this in the first place, and I am honored to have been a part of this for the last seven years. I will still be a member of the community, but I will be participating in a different capacity. 

**Melissa**

I've been working on going through [Blinka](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/issues) and related issues on GitHub and either closing the issues if they have been resolved already or creating Pull Requests if the solution is relatively easy. As I go through and more issues are closed, I find it less overwhelming and easier to address the remaining issues. The goal is to get the issues down to the more complex ones that really should have some actions taken at some point.

**Tim**

This week I worked on validating a recent fix for Read the Docs docs building and creating a patch file that adabot will be able to use to apply this fix to all of the CircuitPython libraries in an automated fashion. I've submitted PRs with the patch, as well as the same fix in the cookie cutter. I've also been trying options for templating libraries, `utemplate` is one made for MicroPython and a community member is working on a new one focused more directly for CircuitPython. This can be used along with the `HTTPServer` library to render HTML webpages with dynamic data populated into them from Python variables.

**Jeff**

The "dot clock display" pull request has been merged. Thanks for everyone who tested and provided feedback!

Next up is some even less glitzy work to better send display initialization sequences for these kinds of displays, particularly when the display's SPI bus is connected to a GPIO expander rather than directly to the microcontroller, as it is on the Espressif devkit and Adafriut's upcoming board.

**Scott**

**Liz**

This week I worked on updating the [2.8" TFT Touch Shield v2 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-tft-touch-shield-v2) for the new version that just came into the shop. The new version uses the TSC2007 for touch screen functionality. I worked on the guide for the STEMMA QT breakout version of that chip so it was cool to use it in conjunction with a TFT screen. I added a fun CircuitPython example that uses the touch screen to advance a slideshow of Circuit Playground characters.
