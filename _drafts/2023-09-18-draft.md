Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Python popularity seems to have few bounds, and the IEEE concurs. And it seems like the RP2040 processor is becoming the favorite for hobby work and production floors. It's a great time to use Python on Hardware! - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## The IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages for 2023

[![IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages](../assets/20230918/20230918ieee.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023)

In the latest IEEE Spectrum ranking of the top programming languages, Python and Java are on top with Python the leader by a considerable margin - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023).

> "Python has become the jack-of-all-trades language—and the master of some, such as AI, where powerful and extensive libraries make it ubiquitous. And although Moore’s Law is winding down for high-end computing, low-end microcontrollers are still benefiting from performance gains, which means there’s now enough computing power available on a US $0.70 CPU to make Python a contender in embedded development."

## CircuitPython 8.2.6 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.2.6 Released](../assets/20230918/20230918cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/12/circuitpython-8-2-6-released)

CircuitPython 8.2.6 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is the new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/12/circuitpython-8-2-6-released) and [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.2.6).

**Notable changes to 8.2.6 since 8.2.5**

* Updated the TLS root certificates to support servers using Let’s Encrypt.

## Limor "Ladyada" Fried Interviewed on The Pi Cast

[![Limor "Ladyada" Fried Interviewed on The Pi Cast](../assets/20230918/20230918cast.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwBl_HNvJk)

The Tom's Hardware Pi Cast on September 12th featured Limor "Ladyada" Fried from Adafruit. They discuss "Writing Arduino Drivers With AI" - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwBl_HNvJk).

> Writing libraries to support our favorite microcontrollers is a big task, but what if ChatGPT could lend a hand? Adafruit's own Limor "Ladyada" Fried has tasked ChatGPT to write Arduino drivers in her own style, creating a "mini-Limor" bot to handle the task. We sat down with Fried to talk about how AI can help Adafruit and the wider community to write drivers, and improve workflows.

## Unicomp Switches Popular Model M Keyboards to Use Raspberry Pi Pico

[![Model M Keyboards Use Raspberry Pi Pico](../assets/20230918/20230918key.jpg)](https://sharktastica.co.uk/guides/unicomp_pico)

For years, enthusiasts have been asking for reprogrammable Model M keyboards from Unicomp. Thanks to the 2022 discontinuation of the Cypress microcontroller Unicomp previously used for its USB keyboards, Unicomp keyboards are now mostly reflashable, thanks to their selection of the RP2040-based Raspberry Pi Pico as the heart of its new generation of USB controller cards, allowing for custom firmware just by copying a new UF2 - [Admiral Shark's Keyboards](https://sharktastica.co.uk/guides/unicomp_pico).

The board, according to Pimoroni software developer Phil 'Gadgetoid' [Howard](https://twitter.com/Gadgetoid/status/1701304106650878398), is "a dual RP2040 'CPU' and 'GPU' HDMI stick for … doin’ graphics stuff on big screens." GPIO access is limited to QW/ST connections and a few GPIO pins broken out via the CPU and GPU debug pins - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pimoronis-pi-powered-pico-vision-nears-completion).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.6 last Tuesday, to add a new root TLS root certificate to the roots certificate we use in the Espressif and Pico W ports. The certificate changes in 8.2.5 updated the list, but did not include a special certificate needed by webservers that use Let's Encrypt certificates.

After the release, I did some debugging with colleagues of a couple of issues that turned out to be hardware rather than software related. Now I'm back working on the MicroPython v1.20.0 merge.

**Kattni**

This week I worked on the Metro M7 with microSD guide. It has everything you need to get started with your fancy new Metro. Check it out in the Adafruit Learn System.

On a personal note, I have some news to share. My last day with Adafruit will be September 22, 2023. I will get into this more next week, but I wanted to include it along side the rest of the announcements. Thank you for being such an amazing community! You are what drew me to this in the first place, and I am honored to have been a part of this for the last seven years. I will still be a member of the community, but I will be participating in a different capacity. 

**Melissa**

I've been working on going through [Blinka](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/issues) and related issues on GitHub and either closing the issues if they have been resolved already or creating Pull Requests if the solution is relatively easy. As I go through and more issues are closed, I find it less overwhelming and easier to address the remaining issues. The goal is to get the issues down to the more complex ones that really should have some actions taken at some point.

**Tim**

This week I worked on validating a recent fix for Read the Docs docs building and creating a patch file that adabot will be able to use to apply this fix to all of the CircuitPython libraries in an automated fashion. I've submitted PRs with the patch, as well as the same fix in the cookie cutter. I've also been trying options for templating libraries, `utemplate` is one made for MicroPython and a community member is working on a new one focused more directly for CircuitPython. This can be used along with the `HTTPServer` library to render HTML webpages with dynamic data populated into them from Python variables.

**Jeff**

The "dot clock display" pull request has been merged. Thanks for everyone who tested and provided feedback!

Next up is some even less glitzy work to better send display initialization sequences for these kinds of displays, particularly when the display's SPI bus is connected to a GPIO expander rather than directly to the microcontroller, as it is on the Espressif devkit and Adafriut's upcoming board.

**Scott**

This week I've been continuing to work on the ESP IDF5 update PR. I've slimmed down the builds so they all fit and reworked the board config to make flash and psram settings more explicit. Now, I'm smoke testing on each different chip to ensure that basic Python URL requests still work. S3 is ok but S2 is having memory issues with HTTPS currently. C3 and ESP32 still need to be checked. Once they all work, then I'll update the PR. There will definitely still be bugs but they'll be easier to find once it is merged into main. I can also follow up with a 5.1 update after that too.

**Liz**

This week I worked on updating the [2.8" TFT Touch Shield v2 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-tft-touch-shield-v2) for the new version that just came into the shop. The new version uses the TSC2007 for touch screen functionality. I worked on the guide for the STEMMA QT breakout version of that chip so it was cool to use it in conjunction with a TFT screen. I added a fun CircuitPython example that uses the touch screen to advance a slideshow of Circuit Playground characters.

## Upcoming Events!
