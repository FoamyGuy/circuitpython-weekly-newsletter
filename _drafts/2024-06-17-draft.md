## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240617/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

This last week I fixed a CircuitPython USB HID issue introduced by a recent revision of TinyUSB. I also tried to track down the cause of an issue with AnalogIn on ESP32-S3 causing watchdog timer crashes or the loss of USB connectivity. I was greatly relieved to discover that the issue, whatever it was, had been fixed by the latest release (5.2.2) of the ESP-IDF.

We are now very close to a CircuitPython 9.1.0 release candidate.

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). I finished up getting the remaining file operations completely working on the updated REPL JavaScript library. This includes uploading and downloading binary files. The library and new features should be available soon.

**Tim**

I fixed a few issues that stemmed from the update to pyproject.toml in the Circup repo. I'm working on BLE support for Circup and the new wwshell utility that may eventually come with it. I also wrote the base functionality for a new cardboard arcade game called Blinka Says. Next I'd like to add some fancier elements like LED animations, highscore keeping, and perhaps different modes of play.

**Jeff**

text.

**Scott**

This week I'm continuing to polish up BLE support on ESP chips. Thanks to the folks who've been testing on the edge. My fixes are currently [in a PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9325).

I've also enabled deep sleep on a number of ESP chipsets including C2, C3, C6 and H2. (S2, S3 and ESP32 already had it.) It depends on the IDF update in the BLE PR.

**Liz**

This week I published the [Pico W YBox3 project](https://learn.adafruit.com/pico-w-ybox3). This project was based on the [YBox2 kit](https://www.ladyada.net/make/ybox2/) that Adafruit used to sell. It was fun to revisit this project concept with new hardware. The code is written in Arduino and has three widget channels that are selected with an IR remote. The channels show the date/time, weather data from OpenWeatherMaps and a fun Amiga bouncing ball screensaver originally coded up by Phil B.

I also worked on a [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch9328-uart-to-hid-keyboard-breakout) and CircuitPython library for the CH9328 breakout in the shop. This breakout acts as a UART to HID converter and is great for adding HID functionality to board that don't have a native USB peripheral, like the ESP32 and ATmega328. I also included a CPython example that lets you use a Raspberry Pi single board computer as an HID keyboard.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240617/20240617weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
