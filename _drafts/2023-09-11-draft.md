[![WipperSnapper Updates Wednesday](../assets/20230911/wipperwed.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/06/wippersnapper-updates-wednesday-blockly-actions-new-sensors-supported-uart-and-more/)

This past month, a lot has been going on with the Adafruit.io platform and WipperSnapper firmware - it’s hard to keep track of everything! To address this, the Adafruit IO team will publish bi-monthly (or monthly if news is light) “WipperSnapper Updates Wednesday” posts on the Adafruit Blog. This will help folks stay informed about all the activities on the Wippersnapper IoT platform - [Adaruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/06/wippersnapper-updates-wednesday-blockly-actions-new-sensors-supported-uart-and-more/).

## Using Conda for Microcontroller Embedded Development Environments

[![Conda](../assets/20230911/20230911vsc.jpg)](https://mcuoneclipse.com/2023/08/25/vs-code-virtual-environments-for-embedded-development-with-conda/)

Developing for an embedded target means using a certain version of GNU compiler, debugger and other tools. The challenge gets bigger if working with multiple different tool chains and environments. Conda is package, dependency and environment management tool. While it is heavily used for Python and Data Science development, it is surprisingly working very well to set up and managing environments for embedded development. Conda is great for managing non-Python dependencies and setups - [MCU on Eclipse](https://mcuoneclipse.com/2023/08/25/vs-code-virtual-environments-for-embedded-development-with-conda/).

## IoT Survey

[![IoT Survey](../assets/20230911/20230911iot.jpg)](https://dev.blues.io/blog/blues-iot-survey-2023-results/)

Blues, an internet of things (IoT) provider, has completed an interesting poll on the internet of things and microcontrollers. What specifically drew my attention is where folks typically get news about embedded/IoT development. Hackaday, Hackster and the Adafruit Blog make up 40% of the IoT information folks ingest - [blues.io](https://dev.blues.io/blog/blues-iot-survey-2023-results/).

## New Adafruit Metro M7 with microSD – Featuring the NXP iMX RT1011 Microcontroller

[![Metro M7](../assets/20230911/20230911m7.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5600)

Your favorite electronics companies have collaborated to make the fastest Metro ever! DigiKey, NXP and Adafruit all contributed to present the Adafruit Metro M7 with microSD. An NXP iMX RT1011 microcontroller powers this board with a 500 MHz ARM Cortex M7 processor. There's 8 MB of execute-in-place QSPI for firmware + disk storage and 128KB of SRAM in-chip. Arduino-compatible headers make using any 'shield' daughterboard easy. A STEMMA QT/Qwiic connector makes I2C connections to boards a snap without soldering. And there's a micro SD card slot to read files or data log easily to removable, wear-leveled storage. The iMX series of chips is the fastest microcontrollers around, with a Cortex M7 processor that is more powerful than the M0 or M4, and clock speeds of 500MHz+ - [Adafruit Blog](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5600).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I got back from vacation, and updated the TLS root certificates for CircuitPython. This fixes a problem with accessing certain sites that appeared when we updated the certificates in version 8.2.2. I removed our dependency on the NINA-FW repository, and created a new repo just for certificates. This fix will be released as CircuitPython 8.2.5, along with a few other fixes.

Next, I'll be working on merging MicroPython v1.20 into CircuitPython, following up on the V1.19.1 merge. I'm anticipating this will be a lot easier because I'm quite familiar with the previous set of changes. Jeff and I will probably tag-team on this as before.

**Kattni**

This week the [EYESPI Pi Beret guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/eyespi-pi-beret) went live. There’s a nifty GIF player example available in Python. Next up is the guide for the Metro M7 microSD board. Keep an eye out for that this week.

**Melissa**

This week, I worked on going through all of the Home Assistant guides I have done up to this point and updated the code in each of the guides to use the newer settings.toml file instead of the older secrets.py. I also went through and updated the Home Assistant configuration code to use the latest syntax and tested every example. Check out [the latest Adafruit Learn guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest) to see all of the guides.

**Tim**

This week was light on CircuitPython for me due to the holiday on Monday. The main things I worked on were library PR reviews, and updates to stalled PRs to get them wrapped up. The bulk of the testing was in the `HTTPServer` library where a recent PR has added many new features and conveniences.

**Jeff**

The "dot clock framebuffer" is getting close to the finish line, though we know that the performance is not as good as we'd like. Hopefully, the IDF5 update will give us important improvements to the performance of PSRAM; until then we will make due with some degree of tearing & distortion when heavily accessing the flash or PSRAM from Python code.

Next up is investigating the code design for generic I2C I/O expanders. Ideally I'd like to enable these devices to work with `DigitalInOut`, `bitbangio.SPI`, and maybe even `keypad.Keys`; and to work with a wide range of I2C I/O expanders.

**Scott**

I successfully moved into my new office space over the long weekend. Most of my other time has been spent on catching on email after the long weekend.

I went down a bit of a rabbit hole a week or so ago when thinking about a better way to store all of the dev boards I have for testing. The ideal is to have a lot of surface area to lay them all out. One way to do that is with shallow drawers, commonly call flat file storage. I found a flat file cabinet on Craiglist but it was pretty pricey and very large. They are often used for large prints that need to be kept flat. For dev boards, I don't need a lot of area together.

[![Scott](../assets/20230911/20230911scott.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

After seeing creative drawer inserts for the Ikea Kallax bookshelf, I realized I could get custom cardboard boxes to fit in each square. I found a custom box place with low minimum quantities and now have just over 20 boxes for around $40. 10 of the shallowest boxes can fit in a single square. A wood 10 drawer set is $140. I'll be moving over to the boxes as I use dev boards (and dig them out of my packing.) ESP boards will be one of the first as I move onto testing the IDF 5 update.

**Liz**

This week I started working on a project using the MatrixPortal S3. I'll be using four 64x32 matrices arranged to be 128x64 to display data from the ESPN API. One aspect of the project that I was a little concerned about was getting all of the team logos across the various leagues (NBA, MLB, NHL, NFL and MLS) to look nice on the matrices. I ended up writing a Python script to download the logo images from the API and convert them using the gamma correction script from the [Image Correction for RGB Matrices guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/image-correction-for-rgb-led-matrices).
