Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Thanks to everyone for reading last week's Pi-centric issue. This issue pivots  back to a mix of commmunity news with a new version of CircuitPython and work on new MicroPython versions. There is also a lot happening with standard Python at the moment, including PyCon US 2025 next year. Wishing US folks a Happy Thanksgiving this week. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

The Raspberry Pi 5 has excellent features, including [PCIe support](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5902), which allows you to hook up a speedy [NVMe storage drive](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6090) for the first time. What does this mean? NVMes are fast, so you can bring great speed and reliability to your Pi 5. If you're tired of SD card storage limitations on your Pi 5, this article dives into when it's worth investing in an NVMe drive - [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/does-your-raspberry-pi-5-need-an-nvme-drive/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there was one new board added:

- [Gemini](https://circuitpython.org/board/0xcb_gemini/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.2.1 which has bug fixes, some new audio features, and adds several new boards.

I'm continuing to work on cryptography to get CircuitMatter to run on CircuitPython.

**Tim**

I am continuing to work on issues across the CircuitPython libraries and resolved a handful more this week. One that I'm particularly stoked about is a new `FilledPolygon` for the `Display_Shapes`, as well as support for setting the outline stroke size for both it and the pre-existing `Polygon` classes. 

I also added some logic to the circuitpython.org search function to give higher precedent to devices with tags that match search terms exactly. This resolves an issue that caused the Pico 2 device to be somewhat far down the page if you searched "Pico 2". Today I've started on a new project to fetch posts from Bluesky and show them on a display.

**Jeff**

This past week, I added a board definition for the upcoming Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, with the RP2350 MCU and a WiFi coprocessor.

**Liz**

This week I worked on documenting the Feather RP2350 Video Synth. This project runs CircuitPython code that takes audio input with a PDM mic for FFT that affect the three animations that are output via HSTX to DVI from the Feather. Initially I was hoping to use the quad seesaw rotary encoder board for controlling the animations, but they were not as responsive as I wanted them to be. Instead, I brought in three analog potentiometers for control and a single seesaw rotary encoder to change modes. This project will be documented soon on the Learn system.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20241125/20241125weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
