## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241125/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.2.1 which has bug fixes, some new audio features, and adds several new boards.

I'm continuing to work on cryptography to get CircuitMatter to run on CircuitPython.

**Tim**

I am continuing to work on issues across the CircuitPython libraries and resolved a handful more this week. One that I'm particularly stoked about is a new `FilledPolygon` for the `Display_Shapes`, as well as support for setting the outline stroke size for both it and the pre-existing `Polygon` classes. 

I also added some logic to the circuitpython.org search function to give higher precedent to devices with tags that match search terms exactly. This resolves an issue that caused the Pico 2 device to be somewhat far down the page if you searched "Pico 2". Today I've started on a new project to fetch posts from Bluesky and show them on a display.

**Jeff**

This past week, I added a board definition for the upcoming Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, with the RP2350 MCU and a WiFi coprocessor.

**Liz**

This week I worked on documenting the Feather RP2350 Video Synth. This project runs CircuitPython code that takes audio input with a PDM mic for FFT that affect the three animations that are output via HSTX to DVI from the Feather. Initially I was hoping to use the quad seesaw rotary encoder board for controlling the animations, but they were not as responsive as I wanted them to be. Instead, I brought in three analog potentiometers for control and a single seesaw rotary encoder to change modes. This project will be documented soon on the Learn system.

## Upcoming Events
