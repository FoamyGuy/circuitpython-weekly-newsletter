**Kattni**

The [Metro ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s3) went live this week. I found a bug in the hardware through testing. It turns out the increased flash memory uses the SPI pins, which meant when trying to use SPI or I2S, such as with the built-in SD card slot, CircuitPython crashed into safe mode with a gnarly error. The board will be revised and released in the shop once it's updated. If you picked up one of the original boards, check out the warnings in the guide for details.

Next up is the EYESPI Pi Beret guide, which has a GIF player demo in Python for the Raspberry Pi.

[![title](../assets/20230904/20230904melissa.gif)](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board)

This past week I finished up writing the [MatrixPortal CircuitPython Animated Message Board guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board) and it is now published. This includes full 3D printing and assembly instructions as well as a code overview and a detailed usage page.

This week I've been investigating an issue with the Read The Docs build process and working on a fix that can be pushed out to the libraries which will be needed in order to get their docs build succeeding. I've also been testing and review library PRs and working on finishing some typing PRs that have been stalled after their initial review.

**Jeff**

After going down a number of blind alleys, I finally have working code (with caveats) for dot clock displays with the Espressif ESP32-S3 microcontroller. My test board has an 800x480 display; the CircuitPython text terminal looks nice and chunky with 2x2 virtual pixels:

You can follow along with progress in the [pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8351).

**Scott**

This past week has primarily been working on the ESP32-S3. Kattni found [an issue](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/8288) on the new Metro S3 and I tried to debug it during [my stream on Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoLcCLuQ5vc). Monday morning I realized the issue is likely misconfiguring a pin and breaking the PSRAM. This causes the VM to load garbage that can cause all sorts of issues. It turned out to be the source of the problem. The full fix requires a hardware change. An interim fix is to have CircuitPython correctly protect those pins and prevent their use. It'll prevent the hard crash but not fix the inoperable pins. The problem occurred because the design was based on a 2MB PSRAM module that connects to the RAM over 4 data pins. The 8MB PSRAM module fits the same footprint but uses 4 more pins to connect to the RAM over 8 data pins. CircuitPython was resetting those extra pins and causing the crash. Soon it'll fail friendlier with "in use" instead.

I've also worked a bit on the IDF5 update and tweaked how flash and ram settings are specified. The settings will make it easier to clock the flash and ram as fast as a board can handle. Right now, we're pretty conservative. Hopefully in 9.x we'll get a nice performance speedup from clocking the flash faster.

The next week is busy for me as I move my office into a new space out of my house. There's a long weekend as well. My goal is to work from the office starting next week!

This week I worked on the [Talking Adabot Clock project](https://learn.adafruit.com/prop-maker-feather-talking-adabot-clock). This was a remake of the [Wave Shield Talking Clock](https://learn.adafruit.com/wave-shield-talking-clock) originally done by Phil B. in Arduino. I updated the project to use the RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather with a DS3231 RTC STEMMA breakout and remixed the Adabot head from the [Adabot Toy Robot Friend project](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabot-rp2040) to house the electronics. It was a really fun build from start to finish.
