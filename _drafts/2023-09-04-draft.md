## More Handy Cheat Sheets

Cheat Sheets are one of the more popular items when they pop up in the newsletter - they certainly help in programming. Here are some new ones out this week, one on Python and some on Arm Assembly.

[![Python Cheat Sheet](../assets/20230904/20230904pcs.jpg)](https://twitter.com/_PythonByte/status/1696001857943204193?t=iZwrkztzXtiCOKnvgi0ltQ&s=03)

Azeria Fox is a foremost expert on Arm assembly and hacking. With her new book [Arm Assembly Internals and Reverse Engineering (Blue Fox Edition)](http://leg-assembly.com/), Arm is asking to retract the title because it contains the word 'Arm'. To celebrate how the community has circled around her, she's made two of her Arm assembly cheat sheets available for free - [Thread on X, formerly Twitter](https://twitter.com/Fox0x01/status/1696622243785191793).

Adafruit's Metro ESP32-S3 puts two cores, 8MB PSRAM, and 16MB flash in an Arduino UNO Footprint. The second new Metro design in a month, the Metro ESP32-S3 includes WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and native USB support - [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/adafruit-s-metro-esp32-s3-puts-two-cores-8mb-psram-and-16mb-flash-in-an-arduino-uno-footprint-15e9411eba88).

LuckFox Pico is a small Linux camera board based on the Rockchip RV1103 Cortex-A7 and RISC-V AI camera SoC and offered with an Ethernet port in a longer version of the PCB called LuckFox Pico Plus. Both models come with 64MB RAM (apparently embedded in RV1103), a microSD card slot for storage, a MIPI CSI camera connector, a USB Type-C port for power, and a few through holes for expansion through GPIO, I2C, UART, etc. - [CNX Software](https://www.cnx-software.com/2023/08/30/luckfox-pico-rockchip-rv1103-cortex-a7-risc-v-camera-board-comes-with-an-optional-ethernet-port/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230904/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Kattni**

The [Metro ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s3) went live this week. I found a bug in the hardware through testing. It turns out the increased flash memory uses the SPI pins, which meant when trying to use SPI or I2S, such as with the built-in SD card slot, CircuitPython crashed into safe mode with a gnarly error. The board will be revised and released in the shop once it's updated. If you picked up one of the original boards, check out the warnings in the guide for details.

Next up is the EYESPI Pi Beret guide, which has a GIF player demo in Python for the Raspberry Pi.

**Melissa**

[![title](../assets/20230904/20230904melissa.gif)](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board)

This past week I finished up writing the [MatrixPortal CircuitPython Animated Message Board guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board) and it is now published. This includes full 3D printing and assembly instructions as well as a code overview and a detailed usage page.

After going down a number of blind alleys, I finally have working code (with caveats) for dot clock displays with the Espressif ESP32-S3 microcontroller. My test board has an 800x480 display; the CircuitPython text terminal looks nice and chunky with 2x2 virtual pixels:

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [Talking Adabot Clock project](https://learn.adafruit.com/prop-maker-feather-talking-adabot-clock). This was a remake of the [Wave Shield Talking Clock](https://learn.adafruit.com/wave-shield-talking-clock) originally done by Phil B. in Arduino. I updated the project to use the RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather with a DS3231 RTC STEMMA breakout and remixed the Adabot head from the [Adabot Toy Robot Friend project](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabot-rp2040) to house the electronics. It was a really fun build from start to finish.
