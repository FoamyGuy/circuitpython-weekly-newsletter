## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added. More are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm continuing with fixes and additions to CircuitPython 8.2.x and 9.0.0. I released CircuitPython 8.2.9 last week with some minor but useful fixes.

**Melissa**

This week I wrote a Learn guide on [Simplifying Qualia CircuitPython Projects](https://learn.adafruit.com/simplifying-qualia-cirtcuitpython-projects) by using the [Qualia Helper Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Qualia). I also added information on [using the new 4.58" Bar Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays/qualia-rgb666-with-hd458002c40-4-58-320x960-bar-display) and [3.7" Bar Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays/qualia-rgb666-with-hd371001c-3-7-240x960-bar-display). In the process of doing all of that, I found a couple of CircuitPython bugs and am helping with testing out the fixes.

**Tim**

This week I ran a patch on all of the libraries to fix an issue occuring with the docs build inside of Read The Docs. A small chunk of them didn't complete automatically for one reason or another so I went through those ones manually and applied the same fix. I've also continued refactoring the web workflow support proposed for circup.

**Jeff**

This week a lot of things came together. I published the CircuitPython library for the upcoming camera product (PyCamera). I fixed a problem with CircuitPython on the Qualia board for displays that were not a multiple of 16 pixels in width, and I am in the process of adding JPEG decoding to CircuitPython using the TJpg decoder.

Jpeg decoding with bug (or, accidental glitch art):

Jpeg decoding without bug:

[![Jeff](../assets/20231211/20231211jeff2.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

**Scott**

This last week I've been in Espressif ESP land. I upgraded the ESP IDF to version 5.1.2 and noticed it features dynamic BLE services. Now we should be able to complete `bleio` support on ESP. (We haven't started though and it's non-trivial.) I've also continued working on improving the web workflow. I [proposed changes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8699) to allow SD cards to be used from the web workflow and found and fixed a big bug in the process. 

**Liz**

This week I started working on a couple of different tasks. I'm updating the guide for the 3.5" TFT with Capacitive Touch display for the new revision in the shop. The new version uses the FT5336 capacitive touch driver, so I've written a new CircuitPython driver for it. I also started working on a new project with the Qualia S3 and the 4" round display. The project will be a flight tracker with compass functionality so you can visualize where the flights are overhead. So far I've been working on the `displayio` elements with `vectorio` and next I'll start on calculating the compass math with a 9 DoF sensor.
