## Open Hardware Summit 2024 - Call for Proposals

[![Open Hardware Summit 2024](../assets/20231009/20231009ohs.jpg)](https://2024.oshwa.org/)

The Open Hardware Summit is the annual conference organized by the [Open Source Hardware Association](http://oshwa.org/), a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity. It is the world’s first comprehensive conference on open hardware; a venue and community in which we discuss and draw attention to the rapidly growing Open Source Hardware movement.

Speakers include world renowned leaders from industry, academia, the arts and maker community. Talks cover a wide range of subjects from electronics, mechanics to related fields such as digital fabrication, fashion technology, self-quantification devices, and IP law. As a microcosm of the Open Source Hardware community, the Summit provides an annual friendly forum for the community.

[Tentative dates](https://bsky.app/profile/arturo182.bsky.social/post/3kavywd4lqm2s) are April 26th and 27th. Livestream and remote talks will be permmitted.

OSHWA is officially on the prowl for wonderful talks, workshops and exhibitions for Open Hardware Summit 2024 in Montreal! Fill out the call for proposals form and toss your hat in the ring to make OHS2024 extra cool and fun! - [2024.oshwa.org](https://2024.oshwa.org/), [Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-8r3w-DiqwWqFqWsyHccnoFcdGer9MyD0XM4isXenHe50rQ/viewform).

## Hacktoberfest 10 is Here

[![Hacktoberfest](../assets/20231009/20230925hack.jpg)](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest! Hacktoberfest has grown from 676 participants in 2014 to nearly 147,000 participants last year - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

What is Hacktoberfest? 

> "Join forces in virtual and in-person events to get your project's pull/merge requests done as a team, learn new skills, and meet lifelong friends. This year we’re partnering with Major League Hacking to help the community connect. Open source projects, maintained by community-minded coders, make the modern internet function. Supporting that essential work, and the folks behind it, is what Hacktoberfest is all about."

As in previous years, CircuitPython will be participating in Hacktoberfest, marking some pull requests as Hacktober eligible. The list of issues is [here](https://circuitpython.org/contributing/open-issues?label=hacktoberfest). More info - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/09/22/participate-in-hacktoberfest-2023-circuitpython-hacktoberfest-github-digitalocean/).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Last week I continued to work on the MicroPython v1.20.0 merge. I'm going through the ports, picking representative boards, and getting them to compile. Most of the errors I'm seeing are simple errors from the merge and needed updates.

We dropped building Version 7.x bundles a few days ago. I updated the circup utility to take note of this.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20231009/20231009melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I added eInk support to Blinka `displayio` so that even more projects can be run on Blinka. This can be used instead of the `Adafruit_CircuitPython_EPD` library that the guides have been recommending for the past few years.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on enhancing the automated library release utility to make it less hardcoded and more generally useful in cases that aren't the exact same type of patch that was recently rolled out which it was originally made for. I've also submitted some old kits to OSHWA for certification. Lastly I submitted the first device simpletest script that we discussed during the meeting a few weeks back.

**Scott**

This past week I've been diving into CircuitPython's memory allocation mechanics. It was prompted by crashes I saw when [re-enabling `rgbmatrix` on ESP IDF 5.1](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8447). `rgbmatrix` does allocations for the underlying Protomatter library. It does this using the existing supervisor memory manager. The manager's responsibility is to allocate memory in the VM heap when the VM is running and then move and consolidate it when the VM finishes. Moving memory is the problem because Protomatter expects its memory to stay in the same place. We [work around it](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8446) by reinitializing Protomatter after memory is moved. This isn't perfect because Protomatter may still use it after the memory is moved but it hasn't been reinitialized.

So, after brainstorming and talking with other folks, we've decided to remove the supervisor memory management in favor of using a traditional heap in combination with MicroPython's new split heap functionality. This will allow us to allocate memory outside the VM even when the VM is running (assuming it hasn't used up all memory) and *not* have to move it after the VM is done. On ports like ESP32 where the vendor SDK already has a heap, we'll just reuse that. MicroPython [just started doing this](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/12141). Thanks to the MicroPython folks for the new capabilities we'll use in CircuitPython 9!

**Liz**

This week I worked on some code for an upcoming project with the Ruiz brothers. It is a prop project to recreate the Fraz Wrench from the Five Nights at Freddy's games. The code is written in CircuitPython and runs on the RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather. Sound effects from the game are played through the I2S amp and various messages are shown on an LCD character display. The wrench is used to solve puzzles in the game so there is a puzzle mode in the code. In that mode, the LCD shows random letters and numbers on it. To do this, I wrote a function that randomly generates a string to show on both lines of the LCD. I hope this project will be another fun CircuitPython prop example for folks.
