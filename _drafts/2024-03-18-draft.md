## What's Inside the Raspberry Pi 5's New CPU, the BCM2712?

[![What's Inside the Raspberry Pi 5's New CPU?](../assets/20240318/20240318in.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg)

Jeff Geerling works with Kleindiek Nanotechnik and John McMaster to look at the die of the BCM2712 system on a chip (SoC) used on the Raspberry Pi 5. Jeff explains why the Raspberry Pi 5 can't be overclocked past 3 GHz. The video also explores modern CPU architecture, clocks and PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops), silicon die shots, and even transistor-level debugging with an electron microscope - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg) via [X](https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1768276659948359787).

## Raspberry Pi OS Is Now Powered by Linux 6.6 LTS, Improves Raspberry Pi 5 Support

[![Raspberry Pi OS Is Now Powered by Linux 6.6 LTS, Improves Raspberry Pi 5 Support](../assets/20240318/20240318os.jpg)](https://9to5linux.com/raspberry-pi-os-is-now-powered-by-linux-6-6-lts-improves-raspberry-pi-5-support)

Raspberry Pi released a new version of their signiture Linux operating system last week. Raspberry Pi OS is now powered by Linux 6.6 LTS. This version improves Raspberry Pi 5 support as well as also including the latest Chromium 122 and Mozilla Firefox 123 web browsers. Various bugs and changes were implemented. Existing users can update their installations by using the graphical updating utility or by running the `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade` commands from a terminal window - [9to5Linux](https://9to5linux.com/raspberry-pi-os-is-now-powered-by-linux-6-6-lts-improves-raspberry-pi-5-support).

## The Linux Kernel Version 6.8 Released

[![Linux Kernel Version 6.8 Released](../assets/20240318/20240318linux.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/03/11/the-linux-kernel-version-6-8-just-released-linux-omgubuntu/)

After several solid months of development the Linux 6.8 kernel has been officially released. This kernel is of particular note to Ubuntu users as it’s the version chosen to ship in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS – i.e., as the GA kernel and thereby supported for the duration of the release - [OMG Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/03/linux-kernel-6-8-new-features) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/03/11/the-linux-kernel-version-6-8-just-released-linux-omgubuntu/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240318/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!
