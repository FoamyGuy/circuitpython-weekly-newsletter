## The CircuitPython 9 Poster Has Dropped

[![CircuitPython 9 Poster](../assets/20240115/20240115cp9p.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The official poster art for CircuitPython 9 was discussed on the Adafruit [Ask an Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/live/_eX5iFtMhS4?feature=shared&t=940) show last Wednesday. Paper posters have been announced for the Adafruit shop, coming soon - [Adafruit Store](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5873).

## CircuitPython 2024 is Coming

[![CircuitPython 2024](../assets/20240115/cp24.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/)

As the year starts, it's time to share goals for CircuitPython in 2024 and beyond. Just like in [past years](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/), the CircuitPython team would like like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the internet. Keep an eye on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/) for the kickoff post from Scott Shawcroft and start gathering your thoughts to post on the social media platform of your choice.

## What I learned from using a Raspberry Pi 5 as my main computer for two weeks

[![What I learned from using a Raspberry Pi 5 as my main computer for two weeks](../assets/20240115/20240115main.jpg)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/)

Andrew Cunningham wanted to take another crack at trying to use a Pi as an everyday general-purpose desktop computer. The Raspberry Pi's operating system has always included many of the tools you'd need to take a crack at this, including a lightweight desktop environment and a couple of web browser options, and the Pi 4-based Pi 400 variant has always been pitched specifically as a general-purpose computer - [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/).

## Linux Kernel 6.7 Officially Released — And It’s a Big One

[![Linux Kernel 6.7 Officially Released — And It’s a Big One](../assets/20240115/20240115linux.jpg)](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/01/linux-kernel-6-7-new-features)

The Linux 6.7 kernel is now officially released — and it’s hefty one packed with an assortment of new features, new hardware enablement, and more.

By commit size alone, Linux 6.7 is one of the largest in recent history - an indicator of just how much effort has been poured into honing the latest release - [OMG Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/01/linux-kernel-6-7-new-features) and [ZDnet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-new-linux-kernel-has-been-released-and-its-one-of-the-largest-ever/).

## NumPy 2 is Coming

[![NumPy 2 is Coming](../assets/20240115/20240115n2.jpg)](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-2/)

NumPy 2 is a new major release of the number crunching Python library. A release candidate is coming out February 1st, and a final release a month or two later. Importantly, **it’s backwards incompatible**; not in a major way, but enough that some work might be required to upgrade. And that means you need to make sure your application doesn’t break when NumPy 2 comes out - [Python Speed](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-2/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240115/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on testing various pieces of hardware on the Raspberry Pi 5 including the Speaker Bonnet, Voice Bonnet, and BrainCraft HAT. I updated scripts and guides to reflect any changes that were needed to get the hardware functioning. I'm also working with maintainers of some of the drivers to fix issues that I found during my testing.

**Tim**

This week I've been testing and reviewing library PRs. The most substantial of the ones I looked into is a proposed refactoring of the network management helper code to further simplify the user code for networking operations between microcontrollsers with built-in WiFi vs. ones with an ESP32SPI Co-Processor. I've been continuing my effor tot update the `PyGameDisplay` library to work with the latest versions of `Blinka_DisplayIO`.

**Jeff**

**Liz**

I was able to take the past two weeks off to rest and recharge. I did work on some electronics projects though while I was out. I built a plant grow light for my mom. This involved building a wooden flower box to hold the plants. The lights are 6000K dotstar LEDs that are connected to a QT Py ESP32-S2 running WipperSnapper firmware that turns the lights on and off at a scheduled time. It was my first time using WipperSnapper for a project and it was incredibly easy. Since this project is running at my mom’s house, I can also monitor it via my IO account for troubleshooting.

[![Liz](../assets/20240115/20240115liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I finally got around to starting to mod a Meowsic cat piano that I had found on the side of the road. I followed [JP’s guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/meowsic-line-out) on adding a line out. Additionally, I took out the very corroded battery compartment and installed an HUSB238 so that it can be powered by USB C. I also added a power indicator LED. I'm hoping to write both of these up as Playground notes.
