Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We all know Python runs faster on better hardware, but how fast? One example this week, the iMX.RT1011 vs. Raspberry Pi Pico, is interesting. Do you want to let the CircuitPython team know your priorities for this year and beyond. Keep an eye out for CircuitPython 2024. A new year and new software is coming out, check out what's new and upcoming. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Benchmarking the Adafruit Metro M7 vs. Raspberry Pi Pico in CircuitPython

[![Benchmarking the Adafruit Metro M7 vs. Raspberry Pi Pico](../assets/20240115/20240115m7.jpg)](https://github.com/LaserBorg/circuitpython_benchmark)

Philip Gutjahr was interested in the performance gains that an Adafruit Metro M7 NXP i.MX RT1011 (500MHz) could provide compared to a Raspberry Pi Pico M0+ (125MHz), especially its hardware acceleration for float operations. Tests in CircuitPython are shown (along with an Intel i7 for giggles). The M7 was 4 to 25 times faster in various operations - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adafruit/comments/194thhn/metro_m7_vs_pi_pico_vs_intel_cpu_benchmarked/) and results - [GitHub](https://github.com/LaserBorg/circuitpython_benchmark).

## CircuitPython 2024 is Coming

[![CircuitPython 2024](../assets/20240115/cp24.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/)

As the year starts, it's time to share goals for CircuitPython in 2024 and beyond. Just like in [past years](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/01/circuitpython-in-2023-circuitpython2023-circuitpython/), the CircuitPython team would like like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the internet. Keep an eye on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/) for the kickoff post from Scott Shawcroft and start gathering your thoughts to post on the social media platform of your choice with hashtag #CircuitPython2024.

## Python 3.13 Alpha Gets a JIT

[![Python 3.13 gets a JIT](../assets/20240115/20240115jit.jpg)](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html)

CPython core developer Brandt Bucher has submitted a pull-request to the Python 3.13 branch adding a JIT compiler. JIT, or “Just in Time” is a compilation design that implies that compilation happens on demand when the code is run the first time. It’s a very broad term that could mean many things. Technically the Python compiler is already a JIT because it compiles from Python code into Bytecode. What people tend to mean when they say a JIT compiler, is a compiler that emits machine code.

Initial benchmarks show something of a 2-9% performance improvement. However, think of this JIT as being the cornerstone of a series of much larger optimizations. None of which are possible without it - [tonybaloney.github.io](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html).

## What I Learned from Using a Raspberry Pi 5 as my Main Computer for Two Weeks

[![What I learned from using a Raspberry Pi 5 as my main computer for two weeks](../assets/20240115/20240115main.jpg)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/)

Andrew Cunningham wanted to take another crack at trying to use a Pi as an everyday general-purpose desktop computer. The Raspberry Pi operating system has always included many of the tools needed to do this, including a lightweight desktop environment and web browser options - [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/).

## Linux Kernel 6.7 Officially Released — And It’s a Big One

[![Linux Kernel 6.7 Officially Released — And It’s a Big One](../assets/20240115/20240115linux.jpg)](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/01/linux-kernel-6-7-new-features)

The Linux 6.7 kernel is now officially released — and it’s hefty one packed with an assortment of new features, new hardware enablement, and more.

By commit size alone, Linux 6.7 is one of the largest in recent history - an indicator of just how much effort has been poured into honing the latest release - [OMG Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/01/linux-kernel-6-7-new-features) and [ZDnet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-new-linux-kernel-has-been-released-and-its-one-of-the-largest-ever/).

## NumPy 2 is Coming

[![NumPy 2 is Coming](../assets/20240115/20240115n2.jpg)](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-2/)

NumPy 2 is a new major release of the number crunching Python library. A release candidate is coming out February 1st, and a final release a month or two later. Importantly, **it’s backwards incompatible**; not in a major way, but enough that some work might be required to upgrade. And that means you need to make sure your application doesn’t break when NumPy 2 comes out - [Python Speed](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/numpy-2/).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on testing various pieces of hardware on the Raspberry Pi 5 including the Speaker Bonnet, Voice Bonnet, and BrainCraft HAT. I updated scripts and guides to reflect any changes that were needed to get the hardware functioning. I'm also working with maintainers of some of the drivers to fix issues that I found during my testing.

**Tim**

This week I've been testing and reviewing library PRs. The most substantial of the ones I looked into is a proposed refactoring of the network management helper code to further simplify the user code for networking operations between microcontrollsers with built-in WiFi vs. ones with an ESP32SPI coprocessor. I've been continuing my effort to update the `PyGameDisplay` library to work with the latest versions of `Blinka_DisplayIO`.

**Jeff**

I've been working on a pull request to add image filtering to CircuitPython. This will ultimately allow images—especially those captured on the Memento camera board—to be filtered with effects such as blur, sharpen, sepia, and tone mapping. The Pull Request is open now, and I'm working on writing tests for each kind of operation.

**Liz**

I was able to take the past two weeks off to rest and recharge. I did work on some electronics projects though while I was out. I built a plant grow light for my mom. This involved building a wooden flower box to hold the plants. The lights are 6000K dotstar LEDs that are connected to a QT Py ESP32-S2 running WipperSnapper firmware that turns the lights on and off at a scheduled time. It was my first time using WipperSnapper for a project and it was incredibly easy. Since this project is running at my mom’s house, I can also monitor it via my [Adafruit IO account](https://io.adafruit.com/) for troubleshooting.

[![Liz](../assets/20240115/20240115liz.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I finally got around to starting to mod a Meowsic cat piano that I had found on the side of the road. I followed [JP’s guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/meowsic-line-out) on adding a line out. Additionally, I took out the very corroded battery compartment and installed an HUSB238 so that it can be powered by USB-C. I also added a power indicator LED. I'm hoping to write both of these up as Playground Notes.
