Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Raspberry Pi 5 Capabilities Emerge

[![Raspberry Pi 5 Capabilities Emerge](../assets/20231023/20231023rp5.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/)

Each week, more information is released on the Raspberry 5 single board computer (SBC). Here is this week's crop of interesting tidbits. 

### Raspberry Pi 5 Benchmarks

A number of folks have been benchmarking the Raspberry Pi 5 using various test suites and operating systems. A roundup of several tests - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-5/).

### GPIO Handling Differences on the Raspberry Pi 5

On Raspberry Pi single board computers prior to Raspberry Pi 5, all GPIO was memory mapped. Accessing a pin was accessing a location in the processor address space. Most software libraries used the memory mapped access technique. With the Raspberry Pi 5, the new RP1 bridge chip handles the GPIO pins. This means they are no longer mapped to the processor's memory. This may break software using older techniques.

In the Raspberry Pi documentation, they refer to the GPIO Zero library as able to properly access the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi 5.

GPIO Zero - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#gpio-in-python) and [PDF book on GPIO Zero (free)](https://github.com/raspberrypipress/released-pdfs/raw/main/simple-electronics-with-gpio-zero.pdf).

### RP1 Draft Datasheet Available

A draft copy of the RP1 datasheet is now available from Raspberry Pi with registers and offsets to access various peripherals - [Raspberry Pi](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp1/rp1-peripherals.pdf). Hackaday also has an article :Why the RP1 is the most important product Raspberry Pi has ever made" - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/10/16/why-the-rp1-is-the-most-important-product-raspberry-pi-have-ever-made/).

### Image Processing on Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi 5 handles image processing very differently from its predecessors. A new hardware ISP (image signal processor) facilitates imaging, built partly into the chip RP1 but mostly into Raspberry Pi 5‘s Broadcom BCM2712 application processor - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/image-processing-on-raspberry-pi-5-our-new-hardware-image-signal-processor/).

### Google Coral USB Accelerator on Raspberry Pi Bookworm

Google [Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started) currently doesn't work on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm. In order to get the USB accelerator to work, one needs to do a few extra things like install Python 3.9 and create a Python virtual environment - [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/bdsvac/pages/google-coral-usb-accelerator-on-raspberry-pi-bookworm).

## CircuitPython 8.2.7 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.2.7 Released](../assets/20231023/20231023cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/19/circuitpython-8-2-7-released/)

CircuitPython 8.2.7 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/19/circuitpython-8-2-7-released/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.2.7).

**Notable changes to 8.2.7 since 8.2.6**

* Improve RGBMatrix memory allocation tracking to prevent leaks.
* Reset MDNS after turning off WiFi.
* Three new boards.

## A Pocket MicroPython Calculator with Hidden Capabilities

[![Pocket MicroPython Calculator](../assets/20231023/20231023calc.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/angel-cabello-s-galdeano-handheld-is-a-pocket-micropython-calculator-with-hidden-capabilities-00e10207dc21)

Angel Cabello's Galdeano Handheld is a pocket MicroPython calculator with hidden capabilities.

## Nordic Unveils Its nRF54L15 Cortex-M33 wireless MCU

[![nRF54L15](../assets/20231023/20231023nrf.jpg)](https://www.cnx-software.com/2023/10/16/nordic-nrf54l15-cortex-m33-wireless-mcu-halves-rx-power-consumption-over-nrf52-chips/)

Nordic Semiconductor has recently unveiled the 128 MHz nRF54L15 Cortex-M33 multi-protocol wireless microcontroller, the first from the nRF54L Series, and the second from the wider nRF54 family after the more powerful 320 MHz nRF54H20 dual-core Cortex-M33 MCU was introduced last Spring. The new nRF54L15 aims to be an upgrade to the nRF52 series with twice the performance and much better power efficiency: half the Rx power consumption over its predecessor - [CNX Software](https://www.cnx-software.com/2023/10/16/nordic-nrf54l15-cortex-m33-wireless-mcu-halves-rx-power-consumption-over-nrf52-chips/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XG8bRNaNHrg).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Scott and I finished the MicroPython v1.20.0 merge into CircuitPython last Monday. I immediately started on the v1.21.0 merge. The initial merging went quickly, and I'll be moving on to getting builds to compile.

There is a [problem](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/8449) with delayed disk writes with macOS Sonoma, which was recently released. There can be a delay of 10-20 seconds between data writes and the corresponding metadata writes. This causes CircuitPython to see the CIRCUITPY drive in an inconsistent state until the write finishes. It causes auto-reload to fail. I'll work on characterizing the problem and reporting it to Apple. Others have already done so, too. We encourage you to report it as well if it interferes with your work.

**Melissa**

This past week I continued to update the [Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays). I added content such as how to gather the timing information to use your own displays, touch display usage, and updated the page on extracting the init codes with an additional method.

**Tim**

This week I've been looking into an issue that resulted from a change in default behavior inside of ReadTheDocs when our documentation pages get built there. They used to install some modules automatically that we utilize, but no longer do. I've tested and submitted a patch that can be pushed out to the libraries to fix their docs builds moving forward. Aside from that I've been trying to update the PyGameDisplay library to work with the newest version of Blinka_DisplayIO, I've made progress but have incorrect colors coming out currently. 

**Scott**

This week we've been hard at work on CircuitPython 9.0.0. Dan and I [merged in MicroPython 1.20](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8481). I [updated ARM GCC to 12.3](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8485). I also [fixed and polished the silabs port](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8484). Now I'm working to [split displayio into more modules so that device support can be enabled and disabled more precisely](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/7667). I'll also help with the MicroPython 1.21 merge as needed and then complete our transition to the auto-growing MP heap for CP 9.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a CircuitPython library for the HUSB238. This is the breakout for communicating with USB PD power supplies. I also started working on a CircuitPython library for the VCNL4020, the new STEMMA proximity sensor. I'm really enjoying working on libraries and am excited that I am contributing to CircuitPython more.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20231023/20231023weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
