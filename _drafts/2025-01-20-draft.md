## CircuitPython 2025 Wraps-Up

[![CircuitPython 2025 Wraps-Up](../assets/20250120/20250120cp25.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/15/thank-you-for-circuitpython2025/)

Scott Shawcroft thanks the 16 folks who wrote in about #CircuitPython2025. He states "It was a great mix of detailed suggestions and big news around who will be working on CircuitPython. It’ll be an exciting year and we’re happy to have you all participating." - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/15/thank-you-for-circuitpython2025/).

## The Raspberry Pi RP2350 Hacking Challenge Results Are In

[![The Raspberry Pi RP2350 Hacking Challenge results are in](../assets/20250120/20250120hack.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/security-through-transparency-rp2350-hacking-challenge-results-are-in/)

All chips have vulnerabilities, and most vendors’ strategy is not to talk about them. Raspberry Pi consider this to be suboptimal, so they entered into the DEF CON hacking spirit by offering a one-month, $10,000 prize to the first person to retrieve a secret value from the one-time-programmable (OTP) memory on the device.

On January 14, 2025, Raspberry Pi announced that they received not one but four valid submissions, all of which require physical access to the chip, with varying degrees of intrusiveness - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/security-through-transparency-rp2350-hacking-challenge-results-are-in/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/14/the-raspberry-pi-rp2350-hacking-challenge-results-are-in-raspberry_pi/).

## LVGL Ported to MicroPython

[![HUB75 matrix driver for Raspberry Pi 5 using PIO](../assets/20250120/20250120pio.gif)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Raspberry_Pi5_Piomatter)

The Raspberry Pi 5 uses the new RP1 peripheral chip for GPIO, different from previous Raspberry Pi computers. This breaks some libraries including those driving LEDs, CircuitPython developer Jeff Epler has programmed the PIO on the RP1 to output image frames for HUB75 LED matrices - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Raspberry_Pi5_Piomatter).

## Open Source Licenses: Everything You Need to Know

[![Open source licenses: Everything you need to know](../assets/20250120/20250120osl.jpg)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/open-source-licenses-everything-you-need-to-know/)

Open source makes the technology world go ’round, forming as much as 90% of the modern software stack via frameworks; libraries; databases; operating systems; and countless stand-alone applications. However, there’s a perennial struggle between the open source and proprietary realms. At the heart of all this is the thorny issue of licensing. Read about various licenses and their use - [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/open-source-licenses-everything-you-need-to-know/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

After the recent release of CircuitPython 9.2.2, I investigated a USB problem with ESP32-S3 that may be due to a TinyUSB update, and am working with the TinyUSB maintainer on this.

I tested and merged a user-contributed pull request for the Adafruit Arduino NeoPixel library that fixes using longer NeoPixel strands.

I'm now working on a CircuitPython DMA issue that broke PicoDVI.

**Tim**

This week I worked on a couple infrastructure maintenance tasks, one was some fixes in cookiecutter to get it so a freshly generated project will pass pre-commit. The other is a change that is necessary to our read the docs configuration based on the RTD service deprecating some behavior around default configuration which used to allow us not to specify a configuration value that we will need to specify moving forward. I've submitted PRs for cookiecutter and the Bundle repo to resolve that, and next I will patch the libraries with the same fix.

**Jeff**

This week I made the initial release of the new `piomatter` Python package for driving HUB75 style RGB matrices on the Raspberry Pi 5. Some bugfixes will be needed before this can be declared a stable version, though.

**Scott**

This week we [wrapped up #CircuitPython2025](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/15/thank-you-for-circuitpython2025/). Thank you to everyone who posted their ideas. I'm very excited for the future of CircuitPython.

My own #CircuitPython2025 post and work this week has been on CircuitPython on Zephyr. This week I've gotten flash support working and also USB via TinyUSB. It is all a bit of a hack but I'm getting closer to polishing it all up.

**Liz**

This week I updated the [Feather RP2350 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2350) to have PSRAM examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino. PSRAM is automatically used as the first line of storage on the board, so these demos just confirm that you have the heap space by running a check. 8MB of PSRAM will be incredibly helpful for CircuitPython projects that utilize a lot of graphical elements.

## Upcoming Events

[![MicroPython Meetup](../assets/20250120/20250120mp.png)](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)
