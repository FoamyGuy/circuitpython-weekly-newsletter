## Five of the Best Budget-Friendly Single Board Computers (SBC)

[![Best Budget-Friendly Single Board Computers](../assets/20241223/20241223sbc.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-friendly-sbcs/)

Single-Board Computers are quite popular in the tinkering crowd thanks to their miniature designs, high versatility, and low power consumption. That said, the prices of SBCs have skyrocketed in recent times, with many high-end boards costing well above $100 – without taking any peripherals or accessories into account.

Thankfully, the era of affordable SBCs isn’t dead yet, as you can still find a handful of boards that offer the classic SBC experience - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-friendly-sbcs/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241223/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**Jeff**

It's been another week of work on Raspberry Pi 5. This time, I'm implementing support for RGB matrices. The code I'm working on now is written in C++, but I plan to wrap it for use from Python code. One possibility is that it will have an interface like `displayio`; another is that it would work like a subset of the Python library in [https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix).

Here, my test code is running on a pair of 64x32 matrices connected in a "serpentine" configuration. It has a 10-bit color depth and achieves a 60fps refresh rate:

[![Jeff](../assets/20241223/20241223jeff.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

For now the code lives at [https://github.com/jepler/pi5-pio-protomatter](https://github.com/jepler/pi5-pio-protomatter).

**Scott**

This week I'm in Michigan visiting family. I'm working to get UART support going in the Zephyr version of the Nordic port. I want to prove out Zephyr as a future base for CircuitPython.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [A4988 stepper motor driver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-a4988-stepper-motor-driver-breakout-board/overview). This breakout lets you control a stepper motor with just two pins; no library required. I found it to be really fun to use and look forward to using it in a project.

## Upcoming Events

[![MicroPython Meetup](../assets/20241223/20241223mp.png)](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)
