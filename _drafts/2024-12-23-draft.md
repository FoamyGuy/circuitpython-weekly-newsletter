## Hardware Acceleration for uLab in MicroPython

[![Hardware Acceleration for uLab](../assets/20241223/20241223ulab.jpg)](https://openmv.io/blogs/news/flir-boson-support-coming-soon)

In the past, digital signal processing and machine learning applications on microcontroller platforms were bound by the numerical processing speed. Several years ago, ARM released the definition of the Helium extension to the Cortex-M CPU instruction set, designed to deliver significant numerical performance improvements of certain common operations.

On many variants of MicroPython, [ulab](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab/), the numpy look-alike numerical library has been a popular choice for those who want to retain the ease of Python, but need to crunch numbers fast. The ulab project is planning on raising the bar and exploiting the advantages of ARM's Helium processors to accelerate many of its numerical methods. See more on the [OpenMV Blog](https://openmv.io/blogs/news/flir-boson-support-coming-soon).

## PIOLib: A Userspace Library for PIO Control

[![PIOLib](../assets/20241223/20241223pio.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/piolib-a-userspace-library-for-pio-control/)

As discussed in the newsletter last week, Raspberry Pi has released a user library for working with the RP1 processor on the Raspberry Pi 5, allowing control of timing sensitive devices like NeoPixel LED strands. Raspberry Pi News goes into detail about this new library - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/piolib-a-userspace-library-for-pio-control/).

Jeff Epler at Adafruit has [completed CircuitPython bindings](https://github.com/jepler/pi5-pio-protomatter) for PIOlib and it will be added to an upcoming release of CircuitPython. Check out a [blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/10/raspberry-pi-5-rp1-chip-support-for-neopixels-with-python-bindings-coming-soon/) and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4_wbllpw0U).

## Gurubase Looks to Use AI for MicroPython

[![Gurubase](../assets/20241223/20241223gb.jpg)](https://gurubase.io/g/micropython)

[Gurubase.io](https://gurubase.io/) is looking to build a centralized, open-source, tool-focused knowledge base. Each "guru" in Gurubase is equipped with custom knowledge to answer user questions based on data related to the respective tool. MicroPython Guru has been manually added to Gurubase. [MicroPython Guru](https://gurubase.io/g/micropython) uses the data from the MicroPython GitHub repo and data from the docs to answer questions by leveraging the LLM.

The goal is to give MicroPython an AI assistant available to help users with their questions. It appears to be a work in progress - [Gurubase](https://gurubase.io/g/micropython) and [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/16451).

## Five of the Best Budget-Friendly Single Board Computers (SBC)

[![Best Budget-Friendly Single Board Computers](../assets/20241223/20241223sbc.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-friendly-sbcs/)

Single-Board Computers are quite popular in the tinkering crowd thanks to their miniature designs, high versatility, and low power consumption. That said, the prices of SBCs have skyrocketed in recent times, with many high-end boards costing well above $100 – without taking any peripherals or accessories into account.

Thankfully, the era of affordable SBCs isn’t dead yet, as you can still find a handful of boards that offer the classic SBC experience - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-friendly-sbcs/).

NOTE: The next meeting will be on January 6, 2025.

## Project of the Week: Tangible Prayers with a Twist

[![Tangible Prayers with a Twist](../assets/20241223/20241223potw.jpg)](https://www.molecularist.com/2024/12/project-god-box-tangible-prayers-with-a-twist.html)

Charlie, in a conversation with Dan Alroy, heard mentioned of a God Box. Basically, it’s a box you put in written snippets of, say, a prayer or a petition. Charlie wanted to do something akin to Tibetan prayer flags, where you record a prayer and it is converted into something you could hang and let the wind carry off what what was recorded.

The build uses a Raspberry Pi Pico programmed in CircuitPython. An Adafruit PDM microphone captures audio with NeoPixel strips acting as a VU meter. Output is to a thermal printer - [Molecularist](https://www.molecularist.com/2024/12/project-god-box-tangible-prayers-with-a-twist.html).

> "The main twist is that what comes out on the strip is based on the recording, but encoded in a visually interesting way. You can then store it in the god box or hang it, but only you and your higher power know what is encoded on that strip."

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've been fixing some CircuitPython bugs. I hope to do CircuitPython 9.2.2 release that includes these and other fixes soon.

The CircuitPython CharLCD library has been slow when used with a character LCD I2C backpack, particularly when used with an adapter like the MCP2221. I fixed the I2C writes to be more efficient; it is about four times faster now.

**Tim**

I completed a guide on Karel the Robot in CircuitPython and it was published *(ed: see in Learn section above)*. I've also created a library for controlling Wiz smart lights from CircuitPython and have started a guide for it. While working on these guides, I found a few things to fix in the screenshot utility that generates file structure screenshots for many guides. 

**Jeff**

It's been another week of work on Raspberry Pi 5. This time, I'm implementing support for RGB matrices. The code I'm working on now is written in C++, but I plan to wrap it for use from Python code. One possibility is that it will have an interface like `displayio`; another is that it would work like a subset of the Python library in [https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix).

Here, my test code is running on a pair of 64x32 matrices connected in a "serpentine" configuration. It has a 10-bit color depth and achieves a 60fps refresh rate:

[![Jeff](../assets/20241223/20241223jeff.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

For now the code lives at [https://github.com/jepler/pi5-pio-protomatter](https://github.com/jepler/pi5-pio-protomatter).

**Scott**

This week I'm in Michigan visiting family. I'm working to get UART support going in the Zephyr version of the Nordic port. I want to prove out Zephyr as a future base for CircuitPython.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [A4988 stepper motor driver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-a4988-stepper-motor-driver-breakout-board/overview). This breakout lets you control a stepper motor with just two pins; no library required. I found it to be really fun to use and look forward to using it in a project.

## Upcoming Events

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20241223/20241223weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
