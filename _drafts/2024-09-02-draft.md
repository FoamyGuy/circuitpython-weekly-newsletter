## What’s new in Raspberry Pi Pico 2

[![What’s new in Raspberry Pi Pico 2](../assets/20240902/20240902pico2.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/whats-new-in-pico-2/)

## Is it time to update the Open Hardware Definition for AI or make a parallel one for AI?

[![Is it time to update the Open Hardware Definition for AI or make a parallel one for AI?](../assets/20240902/20240902oshw.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/08/27/is-it-time-to-update-the-open-hardware-definition-for-ai-or-make-a-parallel-one-for-ai/)

It might be time to update the Open Hardware Definition, it’s over 10 years old (here is my post on MAKE Magazine from February 10th, 2011). A lot has changed in the last 10+ years for open-source hardware and open-source software, and some things have not! There was/is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.1 draft, but has not been updated on the wiki since December 10, 2018. Phil Torrone has some suggestions - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/08/27/is-it-time-to-update-the-open-hardware-definition-for-ai-or-make-a-parallel-one-for-ai/).

> "While there are a few things I’d update on the Open Hardware Definition 1.0 my focus is on adding something to address AI/ChatGPT/humans working with LLMs, etc. I’m going to propose the same thing that I’ve attempted to have the Open Source Initiative consider for their OSI + AI license / definition. Here’s a blog post about that as well. The goal is sharing which exact tools were used and in what ways to allow others to replicate (and iterate) with AI/LLMs, etc. it’s a little different than commenting code, or publishing code under an open-source license, but the intent can be the same. My addition to the definition is specific to this "freedom": "Study how the system works and inspect its components." The OSI + AI definition at this time leaves out the inspection of prompts and data access transparency."

## The New 2GB Pi 5 has a 33% Smaller Die with a 30% Idle Power Savings

[![New 2GB Pi 5 has 33% smaller die, 30% idle power savings](../assets/20240902/20240902p5.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/new-2gb-pi-5-has-33-smaller-die-30-idle-power-savings)

## Compiling Rust, GoLang, Zig, or WebAssembly to MicroPython MPY modules

[![WebAssembly to MicroPython MPY](../assets/20240902/20240902mpy.jpg)](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15702)

Volodymyr Shymanskyy, developer of the ViperIDE editor, has discovered that MicroPython has the ability to compile plain C code into a dynamically loadable .mpy file. This revelation sparked an idea and he has now created a bare-bones example demonstrating how to convert a WASM file into a MPY module and run it dynamically on a Raspberry Pi Pico - [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15702) and wasm2mpy - [GitHub](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/wasm2mpy).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240902/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

I was away for about 4 weeks. The bulk of that time I was on a couple of photo safaris in Kenya and Tanzania. If you're interested [check out some photos from my trip](https://photos.app.goo.gl/iRKHTAnWUtqagW34A). To whet your appetite, here's an elephant crossing a dirt road just feet from our vehicle:

[![Jeff](../assets/20240902/20240902jeff.jpg)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/iRKHTAnWUtqagW34A)

I'm back now and working on the list of issues we've targeted to fix before the release of 9.2.0 stable. First up was improving error reporting for analogbufio on Espressif-family microcontrollers when an unsupported sample rate is requested.

**Scott**

I was mostly out in the last week to spend time with visiting family. The rest of the time I've been fixing bugs in order to get 9.2.0 ready for release. Most of the fixes are in 9.1.x releases as well. The most recent fix of mine was speeding up the flash and PSRAM connection on the Qualia to reduce the display glitching. The speeds now match the ones used in 9.0.x. They were slowed in 9.1.x due to the risk of instability when the temperature changed.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240902/20240902weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
