## Arm Acquires Minority Stake in Raspberry Pi

[![Arm Acquires Minority Stake in Raspberry Pi](../assets/20231106/20231106arm.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/arm-acquires-minority-stake-in-raspberry-pi)

Arm Holdings plc today announced late last week that it has made a strategic investment, a minority stake in Raspberry Pi Ltd — the arm of Raspberry Pi responsible for the new Raspberry Pi 5 and past Raspberry Pi products. 

Arm's minority stake extends the long-term partnership between Arm and Raspberry Pi, which has seen Arm CPUs feature in all of the Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico SoC. The partnership began way before the Raspberry Pi was available for sale, in 2008 — when the original board was still just a dream. Fast-forward to 2023 and there is a generation of learners who have taken their first steps with coding, science and electronics thanks to the Raspberry Pi - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/arm-acquires-minority-stake-in-raspberry-pi).

Stanley Black & Decker has partnered with the Girl Scouts of the USA to launch Maker Badges.

## Gender Diversity and Representation in Popular Python Community Podcasts

[![Gender Diversity and Representation in Popular Python Community Podcasts](../assets/20231106/20231106gender.jpg)](https://pypodcats.live/blog/python_podcast_gender_diversity_and_representation/)

Throughout the years, the Python community as a whole has made significant effort in improving diversity. This can be seen in improvements in speaker diversity at Python conferences, and among PSF Board of Directors. However, when looking at popular podcasts in the Python community, Podcats noticed that women are still under-represented compared to men. They could not find an existing analysis about this, therefore they decided to do their own research to gather data about gender diversity at podcasts about Python - [pypodcats.live](https://pypodcats.live/blog/python_podcast_gender_diversity_and_representation/) via [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pypodcats/111324564294725597).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've narrowed down a problem with NINA-FW, used on AirLift boards, that causes it not to work with certain SSL certificate chains. I now know the exact call that's causing the problem, but it's not something that should be breaking. So it may be some kind of configuration problem.

We added CircuitPython,library bundles for version 9.x coincident with the release of CIrcuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.2. Coincidentally, GitHub CI updated the default version of Python to Python 3.12 at just around the same time. This caused some bundle and library building to break, and the circup program also broke. We fixed the bundles and libraries in the past few days, and I changed circup so it is now more robust when unable to download new bundles.

**Melissa**

**Tim**

This week I've been working on some infrastructure issues in the CircuitPython org bundle that were raising errors in circup. I've also been working on different components that will be used to make a way for circuitpython libraries to specify dependencies that are in a bundle but not deployed to pypi which is optional and many community bundle libraries are not on pypi. The first step was to alter the build-tool to add the pyproject.toml file into the bundles.

**Scott**

This week I've been getting back to switching CircuitPython (CP) to an auto-growing split heap. MicroPython (MP) 1.21 added this functionality for the ESP32. It greatly simplifies CP code where allocations need to happen outside of the VM even when it is running. We couldn't do this before because the VM heap took all of the remaining memory.

One of the major hurdles with the code change was running out of flash space for the added heap code. It occurred on the continuous integration tests (CI) with GCC 12.3 but built ok on my computer with GCC 13.2. As a long shot, I checked to see if ARM released GCC 13.2 and they had! So, we've updated GCC in the CP CI and now there is room for the split heap stuff.

Next on my plate is bug fixing for 9.0 alphas.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a few things. The first was putting the finishing touches on the [VCNL4020 CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_VCNL4020). I wrote this library similarly to the other two I've worked on recently by using Chat-GPT4 to port the Arduino code. Scott also gave me a lot of really helpful feedback during the review of the HUSB238 library that I was able to apply to the VCNL4020 so this went a lot smoother.

I've also started working on a project using the 4" round 720x720 display. This will be a clock project that shows Earth time and Mars time with an "analog" clock face. The trickiest part was figuring out the math for rotating the polygon clock hands. However I was able to figure that out and I'm able to pull down time via Adafruit IO and display it. Next will be adding Earth and Mars modes and converting Earth time to Mars time.
