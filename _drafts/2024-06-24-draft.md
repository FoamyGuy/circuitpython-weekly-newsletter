Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Update: Code.circuitpython.org is a Browser-Based CircuitPython Editor and Serial Terminal

[![Code.circuitpython.org](../assets/20240624/20240624code.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/06/20/code-circuitpython-org-is-a-browser-based-circuitpython-editor-and-serial-terminal/)

Code.circuitpython.org is a Browser-Based CircuitPython Editor and Serial Terminal - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/06/20/code-circuitpython-org-is-a-browser-based-circuitpython-editor-and-serial-terminal/).

> "Would you like to be able to edit CircuitPython code, upload and download files to and from your CircuitPython board, and connect to its serial terminal, all from inside a browser? Check out [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/)!<br> <br>It runs in Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, so you don’t need to install anything. Code.circuitpython.org can connect to boards using the CircuitPython WiFi workflow, or over USB. If the board presents a CIRCUITPY drive, it will access files through that. But it allows you to also read and write files via the CircuitPython serial connection, if you are using a board that does not have native USB storage. And it connects to the CircuitPython board’s REPL through a built-in serial terminal. Additionally you can now upload and download image and sound files for your code, which was previously not an option except with Web Workflow.<br> <br>MakerMelissa developed this editor some time ago for Adafruit, but it hasn’t been publicized widely. Recently she added support for boards without a CIRCUITPY drive."

## How Raspberry Pi Built a Silicon Design Team

[![How Raspberry Pi built a silicon design team](../assets/20240624/20240624team.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/how-raspberry-pi-built-a-silicon-design-team-magpimonday/)

For nearly ten years now Raspberry Pi has been building an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) team in Cambridge to design and produce custom silicon chips for its products - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/how-raspberry-pi-built-a-silicon-design-team-magpimonday/).

> "Raspberry Pi has been designing its own chips, such as the RP2040 microcontroller found in Raspberry Pi Pico and the RP1 I/O controller found in Raspberry Pi 5. These contain smaller blocks, often referred to as IP (intellectual property) designed by Raspberry Pi or bought in from elsewhere and integrated into Raspberry Pi’s chips."

## The *Best Python Cheat Sheet

[![The Best Python Cheat Sheet](../assets/20240624/20240624cheat.jpg)](https://github.com/kieranholland/best-python-cheat-sheet?tab=readme-ov-file)

Kieran Holland is the author of a rather good Python cheat sheet as a concise reference for the Python language - [Sheet](https://kieranholland.com/best-python-cheat-sheet/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kieranholland/best-python-cheat-sheet?tab=readme-ov-file).

*It may not be the **best** Python cheat sheet, but it *aspires* to be.

## Arduino Nano Vs Raspberry Pi Pico: What's The Difference?

[![Arduino Nano Vs Raspberry Pi Pico: What's The Difference?](../assets/20240624/20240624np.jpg)](https://www.slashgear.com/1600891/arduino-nano-raspberry-pi-pico-difference-explained/)

Arduino Nano Vs Raspberry Pi Pico: What's The Difference? - [SlashGear](https://www.slashgear.com/1600891/arduino-nano-raspberry-pi-pico-difference-explained/).

> "Which should you buy? If your goal is to get started with microcontrollers and electronic circuits, either one is a good buy. However, as the Nano and Pico are entirely different boards with entirely different specs, each has certain advantages. For instance, the Nano is the better choice if you're a complete beginner. Conversely, the Pico is highly recommended if you're on a tight budget or if you're just curious about microcontrollers and want to experiment without burning a hole in your pocket. Software-wise, the Nano is great if you already have a background in C/C++. If Python is your language of choice, though, go with Pico."

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

This past week, I've been working mostly on debugging and fixing Espressif BLE issues. I've also been testing Melissa's new enhanced version of the [code.circuitpython.org/](https://code.circuitpython.org/) editor, which can read and write files via the REPL, for use on boards that do not present a CIRCUITPY drive.

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished up my changes to the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and they are now live. This means you can now perform file operations on boards that have no CIRCUITPY drive such as the ESP32 or ESP32-C3 based boards. This will make setting up web workflow much easier as well as giving the ability to upload sound and graphics files.

**Tim**

I have been continuing work on BLE support for Circup / wwshell utility. This week I was able to successfully use the bleak library to send the listdir BLE workflow command and parse the result. It was the first of the commands that I've gotten to work, and now I've got a better idea how the rest need to be implemented. 

**Jeff**

I'm working on understanding the "esp-zigbee-sdk" with the hopes of adding some zigbee functionality to CircuitPython with the ESP32-C6 microcontroller. However, so far I don't have any running code.

**Scott**

I'm mostly out this week because we have family in town. I wrapped up ESP BLE changes and have been following up with more fixes.

**Liz**

This week I worked on two product guides. The first was for the [NeoPixel Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-breakout). This is a tiny breakout with a single NeoPixel on it. It has two JST-SH ports, one for input and one for output, that let you easily wire up a single NeoPixel for your project or debugging needs.

The next guide for the [DS2484 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds2484-i2c-to-1-wire-bus-adapter-breakout). This breakout is a 1-Wire to I2C adapter, letting you read your 1-Wire sensors over I2C. This makes interfacing with them a lot easier. I wrote a CircuitPython library for the DS2484 and included documentation for it in the guide.

## Upcoming Events
