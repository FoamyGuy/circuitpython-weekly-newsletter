Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! I thought this might be a quiet week with classes starting to adjourn but then MicroPython drops a huge update on Friday followed by Arduino. I found a cool new cheatsheet on git, don't forget to check out the 'zine that goes with it. And a bumper crop of projects and news from the web, lots to find in this issue. Cheers - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.23 Released

[![MicroPython v1.23 Released](../assets/20240603/20240603mp123.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.23.0)

A new major release of MicroPython has gone out with several major feature upgrades - [GitHub Full Release Notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.23.0) and [Downloads](https://micropython.org/download/).

> "This release of MicroPython adds support for dynamic USB devices defined in Python, adds new `openamp`, `tls` and `vfs` modules, completely revamps the webassembly port to add proxying between JavaScript and Python, and implements significant code size optimisations for frozen modules. There are also many other enhancements and bug fixes."

## Running Arduino and MicroPython Side-by-Side on Multi-Core Microcontrollers

[![Arduino and MicroPython Side-by-Side](../assets/20240603/20240603am.jpg)](https://blog.arduino.cc/2024/05/30/you-can-now-run-arduino-and-micropython-side-by-side-on-multi-core-microcontrollers/)

With MicroPython v1.23, there is now support for [Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/openamp.html) (AMP) on multi-core microcontrollers, based on the industry standard OpenAMP framework. 

This enables Arduino users to run both an Arduino sketch and a MicroPython program simultaneously on multi-core modules and to communicate between the two - [Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2024/05/30/you-can-now-run-arduino-and-micropython-side-by-side-on-multi-core-microcontrollers/).

> "The communication between Arduino and MicroPython is facilitated by using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). This allows us to benefit from the simplicity of using MicroPython while unlocking access to all of Arduino’s rich libraries from MicroPython."

## A Raspberry Pi AI Clock Listens and Smells for the Current Time

[![This Raspberry Pi AI clock listens and smells for the current time](../assets/20240603/20240603clock.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/this-raspberry-pi-ai-clock-listens-and-smells-for-the-current-time)

Maker and developer Max Björverud is using a Raspberry Pi to power his clocks that use AI to estimate the current time based on **smell** and **sound**.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there is one new board:

- [Autosport Labs ESP32-CAN-X2](https://circuitpython.org/board/autosportlabs_esp32_can_x2/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240603/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

Scott, Jeff, and I triaged the issues we previously tagged with the CircuitPython 9.x.x milestone, in preparation for the 9.1.0 release. We narrowed down about thirty issues to about a half dozen we really want to fix for 9.1.0, and have deferred the others to a later release.

**Melissa**

This past week I work more on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and was able to get Raw-Paste mode implemented. However, the output from the device was somehow being doubled even though the code was only being read once. I also updated the [2.9" eInk learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-9-eink-display-breakouts-and-featherwings) with information about the EYESPI connector.

**Tim**

I had a lighter week than usual with the holiday on Monday. The main things I worked on were the Circup learn guide new usage pages detailing all of it's features, and a new `wwshell` tool that will come along with circup. It's a CLI for managing files via wireless workflows. I also tested several old versions of the CircuitPython core to try to find at which versions there are changes affecting the `FlipInput` displayio widget.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240603/20240603jeff.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I've made the slides from my PyCon presentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1524EXIJRLf5XJSetKCbnN5ilNuicdJ7i1ZHUpgpIevQ/edit?usp=sharing). PyCon organizers have said that all talks will become available on YouTube sometime in the coming weeks and I'll be sure to share that video link when it becomes available.

**Scott**

Last week I got pretty distracted away from ESP BLE work. This week I'm trying to dust it off and keep working on it. I'm hoping to have pairing and bonding support ready for CircuitPython 9.1.0.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [TRRS Trinkey guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trrs-trinkey). This Trinkey has a TRRS jack to create switches for assistive technology (AT) interface devices. Each pin on the TRRS jack can act as a GPIO pin, giving you 6 GPIO. Bill Binko for ATMakers is working on some real-world examples that he has used the Trinkey for. These examples are written in CircuitPython and really show what this Trinkey is capable of.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240603/20240603weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
