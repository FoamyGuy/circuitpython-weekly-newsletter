## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240603/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Tim**

I had a lighter week than usual with the holiday on Monday. The main things I worked on were the Circup learn guide new usage pages detailing all of it's features, and a new `wwshell` tool that will come along with circup. It's a CLI for managing files via wireless workflows. I also tested several old versions of the CircuitPython core to try to find at which versions there are changes affecting the `FlipInput` displayio widget.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240603/20240603jeff.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I've made the slides from my PyCon presentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1524EXIJRLf5XJSetKCbnN5ilNuicdJ7i1ZHUpgpIevQ/edit?usp=sharing). PyCon organizers have said that all talks will become available on YouTube sometime in the coming weeks and I'll be sure to share that video link when it becomes available.

**Scott**

Last week I got pretty distracted away from ESP BLE work. This week I'm trying to dust it off and keep working on it. I'm hoping to have pairing and bonding support ready for CircuitPython 9.1.0.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the [TRRS Trinkey guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trrs-trinkey). This Trinkey has a TRRS jack to create switches for AT interface devices. Each pin on the TRRS jack can act as a GPIO pin, giving you 6 GPIO. Bill Binko for ATMakers is working on some real-world examples that he has used the Trinkey for. These examples are written in CircuitPython and really show what this Trinkey is capable of.
