## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but there are some in progress.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.10 this past week. It incorporates about six weeks of minor but useful bug fixes for 8.2.x users.

I'm fixing more bugs and reviewing fixes in preparation for 9.0.0 final. One was a setting change for elliptic-curve TLS certificates that fixed access to certain websites. I also updated circup to understand 9.0.0 versions of .mpy files.

**Melissa**

This past week I've been working on updating the [Pi_Eyes](https://github.com/adafruit/Pi_Eyes) project to work on the newer Raspberry Pis. I have the main Python project updated so it works and am now updating the C code of the project that displays whatever is on the desktop onto the displays. I have updated the code so it is correctly outputting pixels to the display and am now working on the portion that gets the desktop image.

**Scott**

This week I've been trying to hammer out the last few 9.0.0 issues on Espressif chips before moving onto another platform. I updated the internal APIs for `neopixel_write`, `rotaryio`, `pulseio`, `frequencyio`, and `countio`. Hopefully we'll have fewer crashes now and also work on newer chips too. I fixed an issue with the Memento IoT doorbell example (thanks to Jerry for finding the issue.) Lastly, I just spent a bit of time tuning `neopixel` on ESP to primarily fix flickering on the ESP32-S2.

**Liz**

This week I published the [Qualia S3 Sushi Conveyor Belt guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/qualia-s3-sushi-conveyor-belt). The guide includes UF2 files for the 320x820 and 240x960 bar displays to endlessly scroll plates of sushi. I also remixed a nigiri sushi model to house the project. I'm really happy with how everything came together.

I also wrote code for the [Digital Clock with CircuitPython project](https://learn.adafruit.com/digital-clock-with-circuitpython). Noe did a fantastic job designing a sleek mid-century modern style clock enclosure. The code uses an RTC module and a rotary encoder to help you reset the time. With this it means that for daylight savings time you can easily adjust the time without having to dive into the code.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240219/20240219weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
