Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Fall is morphing into the Winter holiday season, but the pace of Python on Hardware is still going strong. A double release for CircuitPython: a quality fix for CircuitPython 8 and an alpha CircuitPython 9 release (which has brought a dozen new boards). A large number of Adafruit Playground posts using CircuitPython also dropped this week. And plethora of [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/) guides with Python and other projects. Happy Thanksgiving on Thursday to those in the US and stationed abroad. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.0.0 Alpha 5 Released

[![CircuitPython 9.0.0 Alpha 5 Released](../assets/20231120/20231120cp9.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/15/circuitpython-9-0-0-alpha-5-released/)

CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.5 is an alpha release for CircuitPython 9.0.0. It has significant known bugs, and will have further additions and fixes before the final release of 9.0.0 - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/11/15/circuitpython-9-0-0-alpha-5-released/) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.0.0-alpha.5).

**Notable changes to 9.0.0**

* Further USB host support, on i.MX and RP2040.
* Remove 8.x.x deprecations: `displayio.*.show()`, `I2CPeripheral` renamed to `I2CTarget`.
* Add `repl.py`, which runs just before the REPL starts up.
* Add `OrderedDict.move_to_end()`.
* Add `synthio.Synthesizer.note_state`.

[![27 Malicious PyPI Packages with Thousands of Downloads Found](../assets/20231120/20231120pypi.jpg)](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/27-malicious-pypi-packages-with.html)

An unknown threat actor has been observed publishing typosquat packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository for nearly six months with an aim to deliver malware capable of gaining persistence, stealing sensitive data, and accessing cryptocurrency wallets for financial gain. The 27 packages, which masqueraded as popular legitimate Python libraries, attracted thousands of downloads, [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/blog/attacker-hidden-in-plain-sight-for-nearly-six-months-targeting-python-developers/) said in a new report - [Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/27-malicious-pypi-packages-with.html).

## Harvard CS50’s Artificial Intelligence with Python, a Free University Course Online

[![Harvard CS50’s Artificial Intelligence with Python](../assets/20231120/20231120cs50.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NgNicANyqM)

This course from Harvard University explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like large language models, game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. The course was updated for 2023 to include an in-depth section on large language models - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NgNicANyqM).

## Getting a PCIe Coral AI Accelerator Working on Raspberry Pi 5 

[![PCIe Coral TPU](../assets/20231120/20231120coral.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/pcie-coral-tpu-finally-works-on-raspberry-pi-5)

Coral.ai TPUs are AI accelerators used for tasks like machine vision and audio processing. Raspberry Pis are often integrated into small robotics and IoT products—or used to analyze live video feeds with Frigate. Until now, no one has been able to get a PCI Express Coral TPU working on the Raspberry Pi. Pi 5 whisperer Jeff Geerling has the PCIe Coral interfaced with some tweaks to Raspberry Pi OS on an unannounced PCIe card interface - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/pcie-coral-tpu-finally-works-on-raspberry-pi-5) via [X](https://twitter.com/geerlingguy/status/1725590585266876920).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.5 and 8.2.8 last week. [PROBABLY - CHECK DURING EDIT] The alpha release fixes some significant issues that prevented running larger programs. The 8.2.8 has small fixes, and also handles wider variety of flash chips on various boards, so we can substitute equivalent chips during manufacturing.

I'm continuing to fix more 8.2.x and 9.0.0 bugs as we move toward a 9.0.0 release.

**Melissa**

This past week, I helped Erin St. Blaine out with an upcoming Learn Guide project, which is based on my [Animated Message Board Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board). In the process, we found a few bugs that I fixed in the Message Board code and update the GitHub Repository.

**Tim**

I updated instances of `displayio` API usage to support the changes in 9.x within learn guide pages. I finished up the code in the Learn repository last week, and then the non-embedded sections of guide pages this week. The other main thing I've been working on is web workflow support within circup so that it can be used to install libraries on devices that don't present as USB storage drives. 

**Jeff**

It's nice to be back from vacation. I've started digging into items on our issue tracker as I work with the rest of the team on stabilizing the development branch after all the changes that have recently been incorporated.

**Scott**

This week I've been mostly out to spend time with family. I did do two major fixes after the split heap changes that were in 9.0.0 alpha 4. One fixed "pystack exhausted" and one fixed memory allocation errors on ESP. Dan is releasing 9.0.0 alpha 5 shortly that should work much better.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the guide and CircuitPython library for the [ADS7830 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ads7830-8-channel-8-bit-adc). It is an eight-channel, eight-bit ADC, which means you can use it to add 8 ADC inputs over I2C. I'm currently working on a project with JP that uses two of these breakouts to add 16 slide potentiometers to a project.

## Upcoming Events

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20231120/20231120weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
