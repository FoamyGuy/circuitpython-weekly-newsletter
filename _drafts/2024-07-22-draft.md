## Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer Input Devices on Modern PCs

[![Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython](../assets/20240722/20240722jefft.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhwI8ZHhbE8&list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvYhjub9bw4uDAmNtprgAvlJ&index=134)

PyCon 2024 has published CircuitPythonista Jeff Epler's talk on Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer Input Devices on Modern PCs - [PyCon US 2024 YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhwI8ZHhbE8&list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvYhjub9bw4uDAmNtprgAvlJ&index=134).

> "The input devices of decades past hold nostalgic value for many folks. But they don't need to merely sit on a shelf as museum objects—they can be reverse engineered and then adapted to modern computers without modifying the original hardware. CircuitPython... is an excellent language for projects like these, thanks to native USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and the ability to ‘bitbang’ archaic interfaces combined with the fast development cycle of an interpreted language, as you'll learn in case studies adapting these keyboards & mice."

## Tutorial: Writing MicroPython For Your Raspberry Pi Pico In a Web Browser With ViperIDE

[![ViperIDE Tutorial](../assets/20240722/20240722ide.gif)](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-pico/how-to-write-code-for-your-raspberry-pi-pico-in-your-web-browser-with-viperide)

> "You are not limited to just these two selections. ViperIDE also works with CircuitPython, and ESP boards, Adafruit, Seeed, and micro:bit microcontrollers."

## A GitHub Token Leak Could Have Put the Entire Python Language At Risk

[![GitHub Token Leak](../assets/20240722/20240722leak.jpg)](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/github-token-leak-could-have-put-the-entire-python-language-at-risk)

Cybersecurity researchers discovered a GitHub Personal Access Token in a public Docker container hosted on Docker Hub, which granted elevated access to the GitHub repositories of the Python language, Python Package Index (PyPI), and the Python Software Foundation (PSF) - [TechRadar Pro](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/github-token-leak-could-have-put-the-entire-python-language-at-risk).

> "According to PyPI, the token was issued before March 3, 2023, but the exact date is impossible to determine since the logs only last for 90 days. PyPI Admin Ee Durbin was notified on June 28 this year, after which the token was revoked."

## Nordic nRF54H20 SoC Now Sampling

[![Nordic nRF54H20](../assets/20240722/20240722nrf.jpg)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF54H20)

Nordic is now offering samples of it's new nRF54H20 chip. The device has multiple Cortex M33 processors, up to 320 MHz, and multiple RISC-V coprocessors (similar to Raspberry Pi PIO), Bluetooth, Thread, and Matter along with high-speed USB, CAN and I3C - [Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF54H20) via [X](https://x.com/mkvenkit/status/1813082553483686176).

## Python Editor in Excel is Coming to More Users

[![Python Editor in Excel](../assets/20240722/20240722excel.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/python-editor-excel-coming-users/)

With the Microsoft Excel Python Editor gaining traction among customers, Microsoft is integrating it directly into Excel as an in-the-box option, rather than an add-in - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/python-editor-excel-coming-users/).

> "In this latest release, the Redmond firm has improved some productivity features and the appearance of the IDE too. For those who haven't used Python Editor before, each cell in the sheet is treated like a separate code block, similar to Jupyter Notebook."

## Project of the Week: Measuring Power Usage on the RP2040 Chip Running CircuitPython

[![Power Usage on the RP2040](../assets/20240722/20240722power.jpg)](https://x.com/bradanlane/status/1811810602798420080)

Bradán Lane writes about power usage of the RP2040-based eChallenge coin running CircuitPython - [X](https://x.com/bradanlane/status/1811810602798420080).

> "By eChallengeCoin standards this (2.77mA) is horrible for deep sleep mode but for an RP2040 running CircuitPython and having a bucket full of attached hardware, this is impressive! Digging deeper, Adafruit measures the CircuitPython deep sleep on a PICO at 1.4mA. The accelerometer I am using for the Magic 8-Ball needs 1.5mA. Together, this measurement is in the ballpark."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm merging MicroPython v1.22.2 into CircuitPython, so we can pick up recent changes. After that, we'll do v1.23 and v1.24 if it arrives soon.

I'm also debugging some BLE issues. The first bug I'm looking at is an interoperability problem that's showing up when using the standard Nordic (BLE) UART service. If both boards are nRF or both Espressif, it works fine. But if the peripheral is Espressif and the central is nRF, it does not work. I have packet traces from over the air, and am now debugging with print statements inside the nRF implementation.

**Scott**

This last week I've been working on [CircuitMatter](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitmatter). It is a pure Python implementation of some of the Matter IoT spec. Our goal is to have it portable between CircuitPython, CPython and (probably) MicroPython. I'm still working on the foundational packet handling and using unit tests to check my progress. 

**Liz**

This week I worked on a few product guides. The first was for the [RS-232 Pal](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rs232-pal). This breakout lets you interface with RS-232 hardware via UART with 3-5V logic. I wrote some demo code for both CircuitPython and Arduino that lets you type commands into the serial console to communicate with your RS-232 device. I used an HDMI switcher for testing. When I worked as an AV tech, I always saw those ports on equipment but never really knew what their purpose was.

I also worked on the [HDC3021 temperature and humidity sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hdc3021-precision-temperature-humidity-sensor). This sensor has a CircuitPython library that I worked on. This sensor is really interesting because you can set high and low threshold alerts, as well as auto polling for reading the temperature and humidity.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240722/20240722weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
