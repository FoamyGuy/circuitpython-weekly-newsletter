## PCIe Bus Use on Raspberry Pi Delights Community 

The maker community is excited to have Raspberry Pi hardware with official access to the high-speed PCIe bus, for which there are thousands of add-on cards in the marketplace. Here are several articles discussing PCIe in general and it's relation to Raspberry Pi 5.

[![What is PCIe](../assets/20231016/20231016pcie2.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/04/pcie-pci-express-what-it-is-and-terminology/)

Adafruit recently posted four articles to familiarize makers with PCIe:

* [PCIe / PCI Express: what it is and terminology](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/04/pcie-pci-express-what-it-is-and-terminology/)
* [PCIe / PCI Express: Bandwidth](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/04/pcie-pci-express-bandwidth/)
* [PCIe / PCI Express: Connections](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/04/pcie-pci-express-connections/)
* [PCIe / PCI Express: extenders and expanders](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/04/pcie-pci-express-extenders-and-expanders/)

[![PCIe Database](../assets/20231016/20231016pcie.jpg)](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/)

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20231016/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Scott and I are continuing to work on the MicroPython v1.20 merge. I built representative boards from a number of ports and fixed minor errors which prevented those ports from building. Scott and I simultaneously fixed an issue with frozen modules. I am now looking at build size differences, both significantly larger and smaller, compared with before the merge.

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on writing the [Adafruit Qualia ESP32-S3 for RGB-666 Displays Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qualia-esp32-s3-for-rgb666-displays). Much of the underlying work for this guide was done by Jeff, which made the guide much easier to write. I also created my first Fritzing part for this guide with the help of Liz.

**Tim**

This week I've been testing library PRs, include a rewrite for the ADT7410 sensor, and new examples in the HttpServer and LIS3MDL libraries. I've also been trying out the latest versions of Blinka `DisplayIO` and making necessary changes to the `PyGameDisplay` module to work along with the recent changes.

**Scott**

This week I've been working on the MicroPython 1.20 merge into CircuitPython alongside Dan. My focus has been getting GitHub Actions running so that it builds all of the boards. It was originally failing because the tests weren't passing. Now the board builds are attempted, but many fail. Once they all build, we'll smoke test a few and PR the changes into main.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on writing some CircuitPython drivers for new breakouts that are in the shop, starting with the AD5693 DAC. Previously I had only written a driver for the Wii Classic controller, which only involved adapting the Wii Nunchuck driver to send different buffers, so this has been a bit of a learning curve. I'm really excited though for all that I've learned and appreciate the feedback and help I've gotten from the team. My process has been referencing the Arduino drivers and using ChatGPT-4 to convert to CircuitPython to get started and then testing and making adjustments from there.
