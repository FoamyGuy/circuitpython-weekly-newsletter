## How to Fail with CircuitPython

[![How to fail with CircuitPython](../assets/20240212/20240212fail.jpg)](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/fede2/pages/failing-with-circuitpython)

Code can fail as can hardware. Learning how it might fail and what to do can be important, especially if a device running ones code is remote. Adafruit Playground author fede2 looks at how CircuitPython detects failures and how to devise a programmatic method for recovery - [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/fede2/pages/failing-with-circuitpython).

## A Submarine Hunting Game With CircuitPython

[![Submarine Hunting Game](../assets/20240212/20240212sub.jpg)](https://twitter.com/DoomHammerNG/status/1751913265263689752)

[![Submarine HuntingGame ](../assets/20240212/20240212sub.gif)](https://twitter.com/DoomHammerNG/status/1751913265263689752)

For Global Game Jam, Piotr Gaczkowski and his team built a 3D game using a mix of 2D and 3D assets found in their Hackerspace, garages, local trash bins, etc., the perfect embodiment of "one man's trash is another man's treasure." The protagonist is the captain of a nuclear submarine. The vessel is controlled using a discarded washing machine front panel. An oscilloscope acts as a sonar and shows incoming enemies. A 128x64 LED matrix panel acts as a periscope. And there's lots of cardboard for the hull. 

Gameplay consists of several mini games played using the washing machine panel, a PiDP11 (Raspberry Pi powered) computer, and other items. A Raspberry Pi acts as the central game "server" and communicates with other devices using a serial protocol. The controllers are a mix of Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino Nano. Code was written in C and C++ along with CircuitPython - [X](https://twitter.com/DoomHammerNG/status/1751913265263689752).

## PCWorld Reviews the Raspberry Pi 5

[![PCWorld Reviews the Raspberry Pi 5](../assets/20240212/20240212pi5.jpg)](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2219346/raspberry-pi-5-review.html)

PCWorld reviewed the Raspberry Pi 5 - [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2219346/raspberry-pi-5-review.html) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/07/pcworld-reviews-the-raspberry-pi-5-raspberrypi-pcworld/).

> "With Model 5 and the new Raspberry Pi OS, the Raspberry Pi Foundation does almost everything right: even demanding program such as Firefox, Chromium, and VS Code run absolutely smoothly on the desktop. Working is simply fun. In normal use, the mini computer is still silent. If a fan is installed, it only starts during longer CPU-intensive work. The Pi 5 is ideal for server use (NAS), as a media center, for home automation, or as a desktop. The biggest disadvantage is its price. While an impulse purchase for experimentation was still conceivable with earlier models, a clear purpose is now required to justify the cost. The predecessor models are better suited to hobbyists and makers. They are sufficiently fast, less fussy about the power supply, don’t run as hot, are cheaper, and are currently more readily available."

## The Five Best Raspberry Pi Alternatives in 2024

[![The 5 Best Raspberry Pi Alternatives in 2024](../assets/20240212/20240212best.jpg)](url)

Digital Trends looks at the single board computer market and picks five that they believe can be worthy alternatives to Raspberry Pi - [DigitalTrends](url) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/06/four-raspberry-pi-alternatives-for-2024-digitaltrends/).

> "While there are a ton of competitors out there, we’ve picked our five favorites and listed them below, as well as going into their specs and some of their best use cases. Of course, you don’t have to use them in the way we suggest, which is one of the great things about SBCs like this: you can use them in pretty much any way you choose."

## Apple Just Launched a New Open Source Programming Language

[![Apple Just Launched a New Open Source Programming Language](../assets/20240212/20240212pkl.jpg)](https://www.techradar.com/pro/apple-just-launched-a-new-open-source-programming-language)

Apple has released Pkl, a new open source ‘embeddable configuration language’, hoping to take the stress out of ‘small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to repetitive configuration tasks’. Launched on February 1 2024 into version 0.25, the tech giant’s team have provided a ‘[quick tour](https://pkl-lang.org/blog/introducing-pkl.html)’ of the language in a text post on the Pkl documentation [website](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/index.html) - [Techradar Pro](https://www.techradar.com/pro/apple-just-launched-a-new-open-source-programming-language).

> "Pkl is designed around a key value structure, in a manner akin to JSON, rather than imperative instructions like many other traditional programming languages, Apple has designed Pkl to specialise in configuration, along with a few neat quality-of-life features to turn heads. Indeed, Pkl supports JSON, XML, and YAML property lists at launch to generate static configuration files."

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I returned from a short vacation and am now back to working on fixing issues needed for a CircuitPython 9.0.0 release.

I am investigating an unusual problem: on ESP32-S3 only, the first byte received on a busio.UART object can be a stray junk byte with a few consecutive 1's. A simple fix is just to wait a bit and clear the input buffer when first using the object. But I'd like to understand the problem in more detail before applying such a fix.

**Melissa**

Now that I have the PiTFTs up and running, this past week I've been focusing on the Snake Eyes Bonnet, which allows driving 2 displays at the same time. While I was able to get the HDMI only version of Pi Eyes running on the Raspberry Pi 5 by converting a bunch of code to Blinka, so far I haven't had much success with getting two displays running on the bonnet at the same time. In the process of trying different things, I did end up finding and fixing some bugs related to Blinka and the Blinka port of Displayio.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on a Text Editor project for the Feather RP2040 with USB Host port. It uses a TFT Display and a USB keyboard to allow editing text files directly on the microcontroller. I also integrated a tool created by a community member that generates device specific board stubs with the stubs that are automatically generated by the core repo.

**Scott**

This week I've continued replacing our last few uses of IDF 4 APIs in favor of the IDF 5 versions. Overall, they are working better for us. I'm having to retest the affected classes, including protomatter and then will make a PR. Hopefully I'll fix some crashes during file system writes that the old code was susceptible to.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a guide for the [Adafruit UPDI Friend](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-updi-friend). This breakout lets you easily program ATtiny chips like the ones found on the seesaw breakouts. Previously we had instructions for how to build a DIY programmer, but this makes it so that you can have a solderless solution.

I also setup PlatformIO to work on some larger MEMENTO and Qualia S3 projects. Brent wrote a great page on [how to setup PlatformIO](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-memento-camera-board/usage-with-platformio) in the MEMENTO product guide. I had never used PlatformIO before and I was able to get up and running very quickly by following along with his steps.
