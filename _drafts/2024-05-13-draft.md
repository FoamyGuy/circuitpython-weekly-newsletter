## Raspberry Pi Connect Now Available

[![Raspberry Pi Connect](../assets/20240513/20240513con.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/)

Raspberry Pi announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/).

> "It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available.<br>&nbsp; <br>We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect."

## Python 3.13.0 Beta 1 is Out Now

[![Python 3.13.0b1 now available](../assets/20240513/20240513beta.jpg)](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891)

Python 3.13.0 beta 1 has been released. The 3.13 branch has been created and features for 3.13 are frozen! The main branch is now 3.14.0a0. Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release. The Python developers strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker as soon as possible - [Python Discussion Forums](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240513/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

[![Jeff](../assets/20240513/20240513jeff.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)

I performed several releases of the [circuitpython-fonts bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-fonts) to fix a compatibility problem with circup. Now the libraries in this bundle should be installable with the latest circup again.

I'll also be at PyCon US 2024. Find me Sunday May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Hall C for my talk "[Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)", as well as in the hallway track & the first two days of sprints. I'd love to meet any and all community members, so don't hesitate to introduce yourself to me.

This week I've been working on a guide for the [QT Py CH552](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch552-qt-py). This QT Py has a CH552 chip on it, which is an 8051 processor. It requires a C compiler, so you can't use Arduino libraries with it but there is an Arduino IDE BSP that lets you compile and upload code to it over USB. It's been fun getting to learn how to use this board and experiment with the example.
