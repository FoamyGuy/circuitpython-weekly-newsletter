Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! A surprise announcement from Raspberry Pi on a baked-in solution to control a Raspberry Pi connected to the internet from anywhere makes it easier to deploy the boards. The Matter standard is becoming more mature for the Internet of Things but actual use of hardware + software still seems sparse. Python 3.13 gets a major step closer to release. Finally the crop of projects around the 'net this week is superb, I couldn't fit them all! And if you're going to PyCon US, catch my colleague Jeff Epler gving a talk and more - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Raspberry Pi Connect Now Available

[![Raspberry Pi Connect](../assets/20240513/20240513con.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/)

Raspberry Pi announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/).

> "It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available.<br>&nbsp; <br>We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect."

## The Updated Matter 1.3 Internet of Things Standard Brings Energy Monitoring, Electric Vehicle Charging Support, and More

[![Updated Matter 1.3 Standard](../assets/20240513/20240513matter.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/updated-matter-1-3-standard-brings-energy-monitoring-electric-vehicle-charging-support-and-more-88af871283d8)

> "The addition of these new device types and functionalities in Matter 1.3 enables product manufacturers and controllers to begin implementing and certifying these features into new and existing products."

## Coming up at PyCon US: Jeff Epler's talk on "Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs"

[![Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython](../assets/20240513/20240513jepler.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)

CircuitPython developer Jeff Eplier will be giving the talk "Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs" on Sunday May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Hall C at PyCon US 2024 - [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/) via [Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@stylus/112411930220861884).

> "No keyboards were harmed in the preparation of this talk. Preservation is important, and I only discuss "non-invasive", alteration-free techniques here, using original wiring & connectors only. Sunday afternoon in Hall C has been arranged as a lovely hardware mini-track, with a presentation on robots before me and one on machine learning with FPGAs to follow. You can also find me in the hallway track & 2 days of sprints. Please don't hesitate to introduce yourself!"

## Python 3.13.0 Beta 1 is Out Now

[![Python 3.13.0b1 now available](../assets/20240513/20240513beta.jpg)](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891)

Python 3.13.0 beta 1 has been released. The 3.13 branch has been created and features for 3.13 are frozen! The main branch is now 3.14.0a0. Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release. The Python developers strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker as soon as possible - [Python Discussion Forums](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-0b1-now-available/52891) and [Python Insider Blog](https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/).

[![Is The New Orange Pi 5 Pro A Good Raspberry Pi 5 Alternative?](../assets/20240513/20240513orange.jpg)](https://www.the-diy-life.com/is-the-new-orange-pi-5-pro-a-good-raspberry-pi-5-alternative/)

Is the new Orange Pi 5 Pro a good raspberry Pi 5 alternative? - [The DIY Life](https://www.the-diy-life.com/is-the-new-orange-pi-5-pro-a-good-raspberry-pi-5-alternative/).

> "The Orange Pi 5 Pro is a great board if there is a software package or OS image built for it or if you have a good understanding of software and programming, but for the average hobbyist or tinkerer, if you’re trying a project that hasn’t been tried before, or you’re running a project that utilises the GPIO pins then you’re probably better off with the Raspberry Pi 5."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

There were no new boards added this week but there are some in the works.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm working on an out-of-memory error that occurs when using SSL network sockets. I refactored some existing code to prevent it doing some initialization more than once, which it was doing previously, but that did not help. I'm still debugging the problem.

**Melissa**

This past week I've been working on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and fixing up some bugs. I have a Pull Request in and I am currently working on improving the experience for managing files with USB file transfer. This should make using USB connected boards much easier to program using the editor.

**Tim**

I ran scripts to create 'good first issues' on driver libraries looking for displayio examples to be contributed. I've also been reviewing may networking related PRs. This week I also completed several changes requested in a prior review on an old PR to the AVRProg library in order to get it into a good state for merging.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240513/20240513jeff.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)

I performed several releases of the [circuitpython-fonts bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-fonts) to fix a compatibility problem with circup. Now the libraries in this bundle should be installable with the latest circup again.

I'll also be at PyCon US 2024. Find me Sunday May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Hall C for my talk "[Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)", as well as in the hallway track & the first two days of sprints. I'd love to meet any and all community members, so don't hesitate to introduce yourself to me.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a guide for the [QT Py CH552](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch552-qt-py). This QT Py has a CH552 chip on it, which is an 8051 processor. It requires a C compiler, so you can't use Arduino libraries with it but there is an Arduino IDE BSP that lets you compile and upload code to it over USB. It's been fun getting to learn how to use this board and experiment with the example.
