## Raspberry Pi Connect Now Available

[![Raspberry Pi Connect](../assets/20240513/20240513con.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/)

Raspberry Pi announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/).

> "It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available.<br>&nbsp; <br>We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect."

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm working on an out-of-memory error that occurs when using SSL network sockets. I refactored some existing code to prevent it doing some initialization more than once, which it was doing previously, but that did not help. I'm still debugging the problem.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20240513/20240513melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

**Tim**

I ran scripts to create 'good first issues' on driver libraries looking for displayio examples to be contributed. I've also been reviewing may networking related PRs. This week I also completed several changes requested in a prior review on an old PR to the AVRProg library in order to get it into a good state for merging.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240513/20240513jeff.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)

I performed several releases of the [circuitpython-fonts bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-fonts) to fix a compatibility problem with circup. Now the libraries in this bundle should be installable with the latest circup again.

I'll also be at PyCon US 2024. Find me Sunday May 19th, 2024 1:45 p.m.-2:15 p.m. in Hall C for my talk "[Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/15/)", as well as in the hallway track & the first two days of sprints. I'd love to meet any and all community members, so don't hesitate to introduce yourself to me.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a guide for the [QT Py CH552](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ch552-qt-py). This QT Py has a CH552 chip on it, which is an 8051 processor. It requires a C compiler, so you can't use Arduino libraries with it but there is an Arduino IDE BSP that lets you compile and upload code to it over USB. It's been fun getting to learn how to use this board and experiment with the example.
