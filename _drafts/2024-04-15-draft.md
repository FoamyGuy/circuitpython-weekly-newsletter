## Automated Hardware Testing Using pytest

[![Automated hardware testing using pytest](../assets/20240415/20240415pytest.jpg)](https://blog.golioth.io/automated-hardware-testing-using-pytest/)

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) is a framework for — you guessed it — testing! When working with embedded hardware you need to spend some time setting up fixtures that connect it to pytest. Once that’s in place, you’ll be surprised at how fast you can write tests for your firmware projects - [golioth](https://blog.golioth.io/automated-hardware-testing-using-pytest/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240415/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I did some work on reducing "deprecation debt" this past week. In CircuitPython 8, we added the settings.toml file, and recommended using that instead of secrets.py to store WiFi credentials. We've been updating Learn Guides to use settings.toml gradually. But while helping a user, I found that all our AirLift-based Learn Guides were still using secrets.py, both in the shared "Internet Connect" example, and also in the AirLift project guide code.py files. I revised all the guides I found, several dozen in total, to use settings.toml. Soon I'll go back and find any remaining uses of secrets.py and fix those as well.

**Melissa**

This past week, I've continued addressing Raspberry Pi related guide feedback and updating guides as needed. These guides include [Adding a Real Time Clock to Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi), [Adafruit RGB Matrix + Real Time Clock HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi), [Simple Raspberry Pi Robot](https://learn.adafruit.com/simple-raspberry-pi-robot), [Pi Video Output Using pygame](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-video-output-using-pygame), and [Pi Hole Ad Blocker with Pi Zero W](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-hole-ad-blocker-with-pi-zero-w).

**Tim**

This week I finished up the refactoring inside of circup. It's now split up into more manageable sized chunks. While working in there I made changes to resolve a few issues. I've also made some changes inside of `circuitpython-build-tools` to make the examples inside the bundles get grouped into sub-directores by module, previously they were all put into one directory together. I'll be trying to add example loading capability to circup next now that those are grouped.

**Scott**

Last week I finished up my PyCascades talk. I came down with a cold so my recording from [Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epbn0SlKDNQ) may be easier to understand than my actual talk. Besides that, I've finished up the USB host featherwing support (Max3421E) in CircuitPython and [it was merged](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9164). Check it out in the next 9.1.0 beta!

Next week I'll be at the [Embedded Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/embedded-open-source-summit/). Reach out to me on Discord if you will be there and want to meet up!

**Liz**

This past week I published a [guide for the STEMMA Reflective Photo Interrupt Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-reflective-photo-interrupt-sensor). This sensor is great at detecting objects and is easy to code with a simple digital input.

I also worked on code for two upcoming projects in Arduino. The first uses a Pico W with a DVI PiCowbell to display Adafruit IO feeds. The second uses the MAX3421E USB Host FeatherWing with an ESP32-S3 TFT Feather. The code takes in USB commands from a USB keyboard and sends them out via BLE, essentially converting a USB device to BLE. Both of these projects will be written up as guides soon.

## Upcoming Events
