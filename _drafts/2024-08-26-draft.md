## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240826/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

I've gotten sucked back into ESP-IDF land. I was debugging a reset issue on the S3 and decided to update the IDF to 5.3 as well. Unfortunately, it didn't fix the bug. So, I've been digging to figure out what the issue is. I'll be out off and on next week because we have family in town.

**Liz**

Since my last update we had CircuitPython Day 2024. Thank you to everyone who participated! I was involved in organizing the livestreams and prerecorded videos for the day. In case you missed anything, we have a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXfOj_-jSrcGNwIXiX83DZS) with all of the Adafruit videos in the order that they aired.

For guides, I wrote up the [RS-232 Full Pinout Level-Shifter Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rs-232-full-pinout-level-shifter-breakout). This breakout has a DE-9 connector onboard for directly plugging into RS-232 gear. I wrote example code in both CircuitPython and Arduino that lets you use the Serial Console to communicate with an RS-232 device. A big thanks to Anne for rounding out the guide with her knowledge of RS-232.
