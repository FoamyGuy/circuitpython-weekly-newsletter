## CircuitPython Projects Benefit from the Raspberry Pi RP23550

Two projects this week have shown the benefits of using the new RP2350/Pico 2 with CircuitPython:

[![Algorithmic music generator](../assets/20240826/20240826tod.jpg)](https://mastodon.social/@todbot/113002656897629374)

Tod Kurt's algorithmic music generator uses a rotary encoder, a round TFT, and an I2S DAC on the Pico 2 running CircuitPython - [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@todbot/113002656897629374). [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCTPtk6KQQk) and [Adafruit Show & Tell](https://youtu.be/mmqrncofoEU?t=921).

[![Googly eye](../assets/20240826/20240826mark.jpg)](https://mastodon.social/@markkomus/113008671134980114)

## How to Access Linux Ext4 partitions in Windows using WSL (great for reading Raspberry Pi microSD cards)

[![How to Access Linux Ext4 partitions in Windows](../assets/20240826/20240826ext.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/access-linux-ext4-partitions-in-windows)

If you use Linux and Windows in your life, you'll notice one huge point of frustration: Windows can't read Linux partitions, which are typically in ext4 or ext3 file format. The lack of ext4 / ext3 support is a particularly big problem for Raspberry Pi fans. You can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with a tutorial at [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/access-linux-ext4-partitions-in-windows).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.1.2 and also 9.2.0 Alpha 2351 last week. The 9.1.2 release contains some important fixes for certain boards. The 9.2.0 Alpha release includes those fixes and others, adds a bunch of new RP2350 boards, and also updates to Espressif ESP-IDF v5.3. And finally, I've finished the merge from MicroPython v1.22, which is also in the Alpha release.

Coming up, I'll start the MicroPython v1.23 merge, and also investigate some newly reported bugs.

On CircuitPython Day, [the video I created](https://youtu.be/rfCRQ-V_-Mo?si=dTKvOE2UPefAjtI3) was premiered and it worked out nicely.  I also worked on some bugs on the CircuitPython Code Editor.

**Tim**

In addition to my usual weekly library maintenance tasks, this week I troubleshooted an issue in Adabot with the commands that generate the reports that we read out during the weekly meetings. I'm also testing a Qualia S3 project to attempt to recreate an issue submitted by a learn guide user feedback.

I've gotten sucked back into ESP-IDF land. I was debugging a reset issue on the S3 and decided to update the IDF to 5.3 as well. Unfortunately, it didn't fix the bug. So, I've been digging to figure out what the issue is. I'll be out off and on next week because we have family in town.

**Liz**

Since my last update we had CircuitPython Day 2024. Thank you to everyone who participated! I was involved in organizing the livestreams and prerecorded videos for the day. In case you missed anything, we have a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXfOj_-jSrcGNwIXiX83DZS) with all of the Adafruit videos in the order that they aired.

For guides, I wrote up the [RS-232 Full Pinout Level-Shifter Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rs-232-full-pinout-level-shifter-breakout). This breakout has a DE-9 connector onboard for directly plugging into RS-232 gear. I wrote example code in both CircuitPython and Arduino that lets you use the Serial Console to communicate with an RS-232 device. A big thanks to Anne for rounding out the guide with her knowledge of RS-232.
