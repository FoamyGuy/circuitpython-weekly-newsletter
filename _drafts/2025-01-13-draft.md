## CircuitPython 2025

[![CircuitPython 2025](../assets/20250113/20250113cp25.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/20/circuitpython-in-2025-circuitpython2025-python-circuitpython/)

Let’s take this moment to reflect on 2024 and look ahead to 2025 for CircuitPython. Just like past years dating back to 2019, we’d like folks in the CircuitPython community to share their thoughts about CircuitPython’s future. So, please post about #CircuitPython2025 to some public place on the internet.

There is still time to get your submission in! Send yours in to [circuitpython2025@adafruit.com](mailto:circuitpython2025@adafruit.com) or post it to a public place and send the link in by Tuesday January 14th - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/12/20/circuitpython-in-2025-circuitpython2025-python-circuitpython/).

## Raspberry Pi Releases the Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB RAM

[![Raspberry Pi Releases the Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB RAM](../assets/20250113/20250113pi5.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/16gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-120/)

On Thursday, Raspberry Pi released the awaited 16GB RAM version of their Raspberry Pi 5 flagship single board computer. Boards are available from retailers at a price point of $120 US - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/16gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-120/).

> "The optimised D0 stepping of the Broadcom BCM2712 application processor includes support for memories larger than 8GB. And our friends at Micron were able to offer us a single package containing eight of their 16Gbit LPDDR4X die, making a 16GB product feasible for the first time."

They also launched Raspberry Pi Carbon Removal Credits, providing an option to mitigate the carbon footprint of manufacturing, shipping, and disposing of one of their computers. Priced at $4, they use offsets based on UNDO Carbon's enhanced rock weathering (ERW) technology - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/carbon-removal-credit/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20250113/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm preparing CircuitPython 9.2.2 for release soon. It will include over fifty pull requests with fixes, new boards, and new features.

I'm continuing working on getting CircuitMatter running in CircuitPython. I now am at the point in a simple example where all the encryption keys have been generated. At this point it appears I will need to add some needed features to the mDNS implementation in CircuitPython.

I fixed a bug in the CircuitPython MiniMQTT library that caused large packets to be truncated.

**Tim**

I've continued working on issues and reviewing PRs submitted CircuitPython libraries. This week I tested a few on the VEML7700 and submitted a fix a value that was changed in the newer revisions of the datasheet. I also tested some reported issues for WS2801 LEDs and refactored that library to use `pixelbuf` internally. I've started making a `displayio` based analog clock face widget that has customizable hands, numbers, and background.

**Jeff**

I took almost two full weeks off during the holidays, but when I was working it was all PIO, all the time.

As mentioned in the final newsletter of last year, I am still working on RGB matrix display support on the Pi5.

I also have started working on enabling PIO on the Metro RP2350 to use pins 32 and up in CircuitPython, which is also needed for the board's USB host functionality.

**Scott**

This week I've been facilitating #CircuitPython2025 and collecting the posts [on the blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/circuitpython2025/). I've been working on CircuitPython on Zephyr otherwise. I'm working on supporting their flash API and am excited to abstract on top of it. Theoretically we'll be able to support newer flash devices like NAND (instead of NOR) that Zephyr already supports.

**Liz**

This week I returned from my end of year nap. I kicked off 2025 by documenting the [Newxie vertical TFT displays](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-14-240x135-color-newxie-tft-display). These displays are meant to emulate nixie tubes with right angle header pins that allow them to stand-up easily on a breadboard. For the guide, I wrote examples for using one display with CircuitPython, Python and Arduino and a special page for using four of them at once with Python on a Raspberry Pi. 

## Upcoming Events

[![MicroPython Meetup](../assets/20250113/20250113mp.png)](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)

The next MicroPython Meetup in Melbourne will be on January 22nd – [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/micropython-meetup/events). You can see recordings of previous meetings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroPythonOfficial). 

[![PyCon US 2025](../assets/20250113/pyconus25.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)

The community is coming back to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for PyCon US 2025 May 14 - May 22, 2025 - [us.pycon.org](https://us.pycon.org/2025/).
