## Python Developers Survey 2023

[![Python Developers Survey 2023](../assets/20231113/20231113survey.jpg)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/11/join-python-developers-survey-2023.html)

The Python Software Foundation and JetBrains are conducting the seventh iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, they can identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community and the key insights into it.
 
The PSF encourages you to contribute to our community’s knowledge by sharing your experience and perspective. Your participation is valued! After the survey is over, the PSF will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent - [PSF](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/11/join-python-developers-survey-2023.html) via [X](https://twitter.com/ThePSF/status/1722323603360756206).

## GitHub Leveraging Copilot for an AI-powered developer platform

[![GitHub Leveraging Copilot](../assets/20231113/20231113copilot.jpg)](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/)

At GitHub Universe 2023, GitHub announced general availability of GitHub Copilot Chat and previews of theie new GitHub Copilot Enterprise offering, new AI-powered security features, and the GitHub Copilot Partner Program. Their new phrase is "Just as GitHub was founded on Git, today we are re-founded on Copilot" - [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/).

> GitHub is the place where projects get started, where developers collaborate, and where the open source community builds and maintains the world’s code. Now, we’re integrating GitHub Copilot Chat directly into github.com, so developers can dig into code, pull requests, documentation, and general coding questions with Copilot Chat providing suggestions, summaries, analysis, and answers. And, combined with the power of [GitHub’s advanced code search](https://github.com/features/code-search), we are enabling Copilot Chat to understand and help with the latest changes to popular open source projects.

## Reducing Raspberry Pi 5's Power Consumption By 140x

[![Reducing Raspberry Pi 5's power consumption](../assets/20231113/20231113power.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/reducing-raspberry-pi-5s-power-consumption-140x)

By default, the Raspberry Pi 5 (like the Pi 4 before it) leaves the SoC powered up (just in a shutdown state) when you shut down the Pi. Change an EEPROM config, reboot,  then next time you shut down, you should see power consumption go down from 1-2W to 0.01W or even less - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/reducing-raspberry-pi-5s-power-consumption-140x) via [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/11/06/reduce-the-pi-5s-power-consumption-at-a-stroke/).

## News from around the web!

[![PyScript 2023.11.1](../assets/20231113/20231113pyscript.jpg)](https://jeff.glass/post/whats-new-pyscript-2023-11-1/)

PyScript 2023.11.1 is a ground-up total-rewrite of PyScript that adds a wide swath of new functionality, smaller file sizes, faster loading, and so much more. This release) is a doozy - [jeff.glass](https://jeff.glass/post/whats-new-pyscript-2023-11-1/).

> PyScript now offers you a choice of Python runtimes - you can use either CPython (via Pyodide) or [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) to execute code. For those unfamiliar with the latter, MicroPython is a very lean Python interpreter originally written for use on microcontrollers, which has since been used in space, in the lab, and in innumerable hobbyists' hands. This makes it a very attractive tool on the web where milliseconds matter.

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm now going through the current set of CircuitPython 8.2.x and 9.0.0 issues. I've been able to close several that are now fixed. There are many left to test and fix, and we'll be working on those for a while.

I started the ball rolling on updating CircuitPython `displayio`-related libraries to incorporate the changes introduced in 9.0.0, while still being compatible with 8.x.x. Community members Paul Cutler and RetiredWizard are doing most of the PRs, with FoamyGuy also offering suggestions: thank you!

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished up writing the Adafruit CircuitPython Qualia Library. I ended up generalizing the name instead of something like QualiaS3 or Qualia666 because I didn't want to lock it in. This came in handy when I made the MatrixPortal library For the MatrixPortal M4 and later a MatrixPortal S3 came out. I also realized that 666 displays (named for 6 bit on the Red, Green, and Blue channels) may not be the ony displays supported by this library. The library works very well and I was able to do some surprising stuff with CircuitPython such as automatically enumerating the files and then loading and instantiating the given display, which makes adding new displays much easier.

**Tim**

This week I worked on changes for circup that allow it to check inside of the pyproject.toml to find a list of dependencies that are in CircuitPython bundles, but not deployed to PyPI and install them alongside the other dependencies that it installs. I've also been working through the Learn Guide repo and updating instances of 'displayio' usage for the new API in CircuitPython 9.x.

**Scott**

I haven't been doing a bunch this week because my mom is in the hospital. Dan did merge in the split heap stuff so please try the next 9.0.0 alpha with it. I did a little debugging on SD card support on the ESP32-S3 but didn't figure out the issue. Thanks to Foamyguy for doing Deep Dive last week and this week.

**Liz**

I've continued working on the Mars clock project but ran into an issue when calculating Mars time (MTC). I was hitting the float limits of CircuitPython. Luckily, I was pointed in the direction of the [CircuitPython Decimal library](https://github.com/jepler/Jepler_CircuitPython_udecimal) that Jepler wrote. Using that library, I was able to accurately calculate MTC in CircuitPython and wrap up the code for the project. I documented the process of troubleshooting this issue in a [Playground note](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/BlitzCityDIY/pages/accurately-calculating-coordinated-mars-time-with-circuitpython) that goes through the algorithm for calculating MTC, what the original result was in CircuitPython versus CPython and why the decimal CircuitPython library saves the day.
