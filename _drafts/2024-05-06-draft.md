## MicroPython is Now 11 Years Old

[![MicroPython is Now 11 Years Old](../assets/20240506/20240506eleven.jpg)](https://twitter.com/micropython/status/1784874073329180975)

MicroPython has turned eleven, having started in 2013 - [X](https://twitter.com/micropython/status/1784874073329180975).

> “MicroPython started life in early 2013 as an experiment, to see if it was possible to shrink a high-level language like Python down enough to run on very small devices. Now MicroPython is a mature open-source project that is relied upon by a wide variety of users."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240506/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

Ubuntu 24.04 final was released just last week. Over the previous weekend I upgraded my development machine, so I could be a guinea pig for changes that will be needed when building CircuitPython.

As we saw with Debian Bookworm, installing Python libraries for your own use needs to be done in a Python virtual environment, such as "venv", unless you override some safety protections. Carter already wrote [a Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi0 about this for the new release of Raspberry Pi OS.

I'll be updating the [Building CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython) Guide to cover this and other needed recipe changes.

**Melissa**

I finished up going through Raspberry Pi related guides, addressing feedback, and updating older guides this past week. The last couple of guides that I updated include [Raspberry Pi Wearable Time Lapse Camera](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-wearable-time-lapse-camera) and [Adafruit MAX98357 I2S Class-D Mono Amp](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-max98357-i2s-class-d-mono-amp).

**Tim**

I've been testing and reviewing PRs for changes to requests and networking related libraries this week, there is loads of great work taking place around ConnectionManager and the libraries it can interact with to simplify networking. I'm also creating some scripts to create new github issues in a subset of the libraries for creating displayio based sensor examples.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20240506/20240506jeff.png)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

I've been working on MP3 support for the ESP32-S3 for a couple of weeks without anything to show for it. But finally with some hints from Scott & lots of time debugging the code, I got stable MP3 playback on the Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 TFT.

One of the things I did along the way was measure the performance of MP3 playback on the S3. In this scope trace, the "D0" trace shows the time spent decoding a 22kHz 48kbit/s MP3 file stored on internal flash; it takes about 2ms every 46ms, or about 5% of the total CPU available.

Playing other MP3 files or playing MP3 files from an SD card might take more time, but it gives the impression that there's plenty of headroom available for higher bitrate MP3 files.

**Scott**

This week I took a little detour to enable the MAX3421E on ESP chips. (I thought I had but someone testing it found I hadn't.) This included enabling it on non-USB device ESP chips like the C3 and C6. Absolute latest builds now include the `max3421e` module correctly.

I've been shepherding the Renode support along. It should be merged any day now.

Lastly, I've been working on BLE GATT server support on ESP. This is needed for BLE HID device functionality in particular.

**Liz**

I took a little time off last week but now I'm back to writing guides. I wrote up guides for a few new products: the [BNO055 + BMP280 BFF](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-bmp280-bff), the [STEMMA IR Demodulator](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tssp77038-38khz-infrared-ir-demodulator-breakout) and the [DVI Sock for Pico](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dvi-sock-for-pico). I also wrote up my project using a USB Host FeatherWing and Feather ESP32-S3 TFT to build a [USB to BLE adapter](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-usb-to-ble-keyboard-adapter). The code is written in Arduino, but with the recently added support for the USB Host FeatherWing and impending support for BLE on Espressif in CircuitPython, I'm hopeful to have code in CircuitPython for it at some point.
