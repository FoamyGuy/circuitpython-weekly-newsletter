## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20250127/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.2.3 about ten days ago to fix a problem with USB and ESP32-S3. Since then, another fix has been made for USB and STM, and I hope to release 9.2.4 soon, along with some other fixes.

I'm now working on completing an update to the NINA-FW firmware for AirLift co-processors that will allow using elliptic cryptography certificate chains. A lot of this work was done more than a year ago, but it still needs to be debugged.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on some fixes for Blinka Displayio. I also searched the bundle for and fixed a few instances of our docs conf.py using deprecated Python modules. Lastly, I tested all of the CircuitPython examples for the Sparkle Motion Mini product guide pages. 

**Jeff**

I've continued working in Raspberry Pi 5 land, making improvements to the `piomatter` Python package for driving HUB75 style RGB matrices. This includes an example where part of the "/dev/fb0" framebuffer is copied and displayed on an attached matrix.

**Scott**

I'm continuing to work on CircuitPython on Zephyr. I fixed flash support so that CIRCUITPY is writable. I've changed memory management to support multiple RAM regions including SDRAM. The RA8 dev board has an external flash with varying page sizes so I've added support for a uniform subregion. I'm hoping to get WiFi working next.

**Liz**

This week I worked on CircuitPython code for a [motorized turntable project](https://learn.adafruit.com/motorized-turntable-3) with Noe. This turntable is meant for getting dynamic video shots. It uses the new TMC2209 silent stepper motor driver, which works by toggling the step pin to move the motor. I found that when I added the rotary encoder and button checks into the loop, even with ticks, that the driver basically stalled and wasn't moving. I switched to `asyncio` and that allowed the project to work with toggling the step pin, reading the rotary encoder and button and updating the OLED screen. I'm hoping this will be a nice demo for folks on how to use `asyncio`, which can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.

## Upcoming Events

[![MicroPython Meetup](../assets/20250127/20250127mp.png)](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)

The next MicroPython Meetup in Melbourne will be on February 26th â€“ [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/micropython-meetup/events). You can see recordings of previous meetings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroPythonOfficial). 

[![PyCon US 2025](../assets/20250127/pyconus25.jpg)](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)

The community is coming back to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for PyCon US 2025 May 14 - May 22, 2025 - [us.pycon.org](https://us.pycon.org/2025/).
