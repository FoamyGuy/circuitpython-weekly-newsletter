Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This week's issue has a couple of features. First are three how-to articles on Meshtastic, Time-of-Flight sensors and the pitfalls of Raspberry Pi PIO. Second is new materials for teaching CircuitPython at Boston College. We're all searching for easier ways of doing our projects, and this issue might just help with that and spur creativity. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/circuitpython.org) and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Arduino Launches a MicroPython Package Manager

[![Arduino Launches a MicroPython Package Manager](../assets/20250127/20250127pack.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-launches-a-micropython-package-manager-for-easier-library-installation-f67cf7604048)

The Arduino team has announced a new library management system aimed at making it easier to write MicroPython code for compatible Arduino microcontrollers by providing single-click installation from an official package index - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-launches-a-micropython-package-manager-for-easier-library-installation-f67cf7604048) and [Arduino Blog](https://blog.arduino.cc/2025/01/21/micropython-programming-on-arduino-just-got-easier/).

> "The Arduino Lab for MicroPython has now gained an external package management system. Run outside the IDE itself, it works almost identically to the library manager in the standard Arduino IDE: it connects to an official package index and provides a searchable list of libraries, any one of which can be installed to a compatible microcontroller board in a single click. It also provides a way to add third-party packages from a URL — and all files can be automatically converted to MPY format for inclusion in a sketch.<br> <br>The official package index includes, the Arduino team says, both officially-maintained packages, MicroPython standard libraries, and community contributions; those interested in adding to the latter are invited to send pull requests in to [the MicroPython Package Index on GitHub](https://github.com/arduino/package-index-py/).<br> <br>Those who just want to try it out as an end-user, meanwhile, can find the source code and initial release on [GitHub](https://github.com/arduino/lab-micropython-package-installer?tab=readme-ov-file). Boards supported are the Arduino Portenta H7, Portenta C33, Nicla Vision, Giga, Nano RP2040, Nano ESP32, and Nano 33 BLE; "this tool may work for third party boards too," the Arduino team notes, but warns "this is, however, not officially supported."

## MicroPython at FOSDEM

[![MicroPython at FOSDEM](../assets/20250127/20250127fosdem.jpg)](https://x.com/micropython/status/1881661639209930838?t=xLLPAgM27LMWvteRfXVgAw&s=03)

MicroPython will once again be joining forces with Espruino at [FOSDFEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/) this year, 1-2 February in Brussels. Their table will be in building AW and they'd like you to show off your projects using MicroPython. There will also be two [talks by Jon Nordby](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4524-milliwatt-sized-machine-learning-on-microcontrollers-with-emlearn/) - [X](https://x.com/micropython/status/1881661639209930838?t=xLLPAgM27LMWvteRfXVgAw&s=03).

## The Boston College Semester of Code

[![Semester of Code](../assets/20250127/20250127prof.jpg)](https://mastodon.world/@gallaugher/113878268732153363)

Prof. John Gallaugher of Boston College posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/@gallaugher/113878268732153363):

> "If anyone wants to get in on a newbie-friendly #SemesterOfCircuitPython I am posting all of our weekly flipped class lessons in a playlist at [YouTube.com/@BuildWithProfG](https://www.youtube.com/@BuildWithProfG). Plus weekly notes in Keynote & .pdf format, complete with in-class challenges in the PhysComp Google drive at [Gallaugher.com](https://gallaugher.com/). The first 2 weeks have lots of set up/config/background info. Starting with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit, switching to Raspberry Pi Pico W midsemester. PyCharm, CircUp. All welcome!"

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were four new boards added:

- [M5Stamp S3](https://circuitpython.org/board/m5stack_stamp_s3/)
- [PicoMo V3](https://circuitpython.org/board/picomo_v3/)
- [Adafruit Sparkle Motion](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_sparkle_motion/)
- [Adafruit Mini Sparkle Motion](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_mini_sparkle_motion/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.2.3 about ten days ago to fix a problem with USB and ESP32-S3. Since then, another fix has been made for USB and STM, and I hope to release 9.2.4 soon, along with some other fixes.

I'm now working on completing an update to the NINA-FW firmware for AirLift co-processors that will allow using elliptic cryptography certificate chains. A lot of this work was done more than a year ago, but it still needs to be debugged.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on some fixes for Blinka Displayio. I also searched the bundle for and fixed a few instances of our docs conf.py using deprecated Python modules. Lastly, I tested all of the CircuitPython examples for the Sparkle Motion Mini product guide pages. 

**Jeff**

I've continued working in Raspberry Pi 5 land, making improvements to the `piomatter` Python package for driving HUB75 style RGB matrices. This includes an example where part of the "/dev/fb0" framebuffer is copied and displayed on an attached matrix.

**Scott**

I'm continuing to work on CircuitPython on Zephyr. I fixed flash support so that CIRCUITPY is writable. I've changed memory management to support multiple RAM regions including SDRAM. The RA8 dev board has an external flash with varying page sizes so I've added support for a uniform subregion. I'm hoping to get WiFi working next.

**Liz**

This week I worked on CircuitPython code for a [motorized turntable project](https://learn.adafruit.com/motorized-turntable-3) with Noe. This turntable is meant for getting dynamic video shots. It uses the new TMC2209 silent stepper motor driver, which works by toggling the step pin to move the motor. I found that when I added the rotary encoder and button checks into the loop, even with ticks, that the driver basically stalled and wasn't moving. I switched to `asyncio` and that allowed the project to work with toggling the step pin, reading the rotary encoder and button and updating the OLED screen. I'm hoping this will be a nice demo for folks on how to use `asyncio`, which can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.
