## You Can Actually run Linux on the RISC-V Cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s RP2350

[![Linux on the RISC-V cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s RP2350](../assets/20241021/20241021linux.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-risc-v-cores-raspberry-pi-pico-2-rp2350/)

When the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 came out, it didn’t take long for someone to figure out crazy uses for its [RISC-V Hazard3 CPU cores](https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-why-risc-v-is-important/). After all, folks figured out how to pull off amazing feats with the original Pico, like emulating the Macintosh 128K. The RISC-V CPU is more commonly used in application-class processors than microcontrollers, so one developer set to work installing Linux on the RISC-V cores - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-risc-v-cores-raspberry-pi-pico-2-rp2350/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've been fixing more BLE bugs in the past week. It looks like we will soon have no more issues we want to fix for 9.2.0, and so we'll probably do a release candidate soon.

I've been talking with Scott about CircuitMatter and expect to continue CircuitMatter development while Scott is on paternity leave.

**Tim**

This week I wrapped up a guide for my Spirit Board and it's been published. I've also started reviewing Blinka and CircuitPython.org PRs which required me to get set up for testing the .org site locally. Lastly I patched and released a change in all of the libraries to fix an issue resulting from a deprecation in sphinx RTD theme that our docs use.

**Jeff**

I added a [monophonic version of CircuitPython Audio FX](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-audio-fx/audio-fx-monophonic) to my recent guide. The goal is for this code to be drop-in compatible with the Audio FX product (except for needing MP3 files, not OGG files).

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on CircuitMatter and reached my goal of having my code work with Apple Home. I can commission into Apple Home and toggle as a light. However, this isn't done. CircuitMatter code doesn't currently remember its state so you need to commission every time after startup. It also doesn't run on CircuitPython. I'm about to go on paternity leave so we'll see how far I get before then.

**Liz**

This week I worked on two project guides. The first was the [DIY Turbo Button Controller - HID Remapper](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-turbo-button-controller-hid-remapper). It uses an RP2040 USB Host Feather to create a turbo button gamepad. The Feather acts as a transparent passthrough for the controller and sends any button pushes. When a specific combo is pressed, it sends a turbo button aka a rapidly pressed A button. 

The second project was the [QT Py CH32V203 eInk / ePaper Daily Calendar and Clock](https://learn.adafruit.com/ch32v203-eink-epaper-calendar-and-clock). It uses the QT Py CH32V203. I put together a simple eInk daily calendar with it using an EYESPI BFF and a STEMMA RTC module. I was inspired to build this after JP showcased the QT Py for his Product Pick of the Week show. I had written the product guide for it a few weeks back and hadn't had a chance to revisit it. I have a few more project ideas for the board that I'm hoping to put together.
