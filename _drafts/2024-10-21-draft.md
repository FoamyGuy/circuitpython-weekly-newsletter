## MicroPython v1.24.0 is Nearly There

[![MicroPython v1.24.0](../assets/20241021/20241021mp24.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/milestone/7)

MicroPython v1.24 is getting *very* close to release. Two out of three milestones have been completed to date with a [major pull request for RP2350 support](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/15619) being merged this past week. There is still a [preview release](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.0-preview) available for those who wish to check things out - [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/milestone/7).

## Python 3.14 Alpha 1 Released With Early Changes

[![Python 3.14 Alpha 1 Released With Early Changes](../assets/20241021/20241021p314.jpg)](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Python-3.14-Alpha-1)

It was just last week that [Python 3.13 saw its official release](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Python-3.13-Released) with many great features from a new interactive interpreter to an experimental JIT and removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in the experimental free-threaded build mode. Python 3.14 Alpha 1 is now out in the first very early stage development milestone toward next year's big Python update - [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Python-3.14-Alpha-1) and [PSF](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140a1/).

## You Can Actually run Linux on the RISC-V Cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s RP2350

[![Linux on the RISC-V cores of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2’s RP2350](../assets/20241021/20241021linux.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-risc-v-cores-raspberry-pi-pico-2-rp2350/)

When the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 came out, it didn’t take long for someone to figure out crazy uses for its [RISC-V Hazard3 CPU cores](https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-why-risc-v-is-important/). After all, folks figured out how to pull off amazing feats with the original Pico, like emulating the Macintosh 128K. The RISC-V CPU is more commonly used in application-class processors than microcontrollers, so one developer set to work installing Linux on the RISC-V cores - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-risc-v-cores-raspberry-pi-pico-2-rp2350/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241021/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

[![Dan](../assets/20241021/20241021dan.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

text.

**Tim**

This week I wrapped up a guide for my Spirit Board and it's been published. I've also started reviewing Blinka and CircuitPython.org PRs which required me to get set up for testing the .org site locally. Lastly I patched and released a change in all of the libraries to fix an issue resulting from a deprecation in sphinx RTD theme that our docs use.

**Jeff**

I added a [monophonic version of CircuitPython Audio FX](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-audio-fx/audio-fx-monophonic) to my recent guide. The goal is for this code to be drop-in compatible with the Audio FX product (except for needing MP3 files, not OGG files).

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on CircuitMatter and reached my goal of having my code work with Apple Home. I can commission into Apple Home and toggle as a light. However, this isn't done. CircuitMatter code doesn't currently remember its state so you need to commission every time after startup. It also doesn't run on CircuitPython. I'm about to go on paternity leave so we'll see how far I get before then.

**Liz**

This week I worked on two project guides. The first was the [DIY Turbo Button Controller - HID Remapper](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-turbo-button-controller-hid-remapper). It uses an RP2040 USB Host Feather to create a turbo button gamepad. The Feather acts as a transparent passthrough for the controller and sends any button pushes. When a specific combo is pressed, it sends a turbo button aka a rapidly pressed A button. 

The second project was the [QT Py CH32V203 eInk / ePaper Daily Calendar and Clock](https://learn.adafruit.com/ch32v203-eink-epaper-calendar-and-clock). It uses the QT Py CH32V203. I put together a simple eInk daily calendar with it using an EYESPI BFF and a STEMMA RTC module. I was inspired to build this after JP showcased the QT Py for his Product Pick of the Week show. I had written the product guide for it a few weeks back and hadn't had a chance to revisit it. I have a few more project ideas for the board that I'm hoping to put together.

## Upcoming Events
