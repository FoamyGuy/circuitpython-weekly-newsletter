## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards added.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## New Learn Guides

[![New Learn Guides](../assets/20241014/20241014learn.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest)

The Adafruit Learning System has over 3,000 free guides for learning skills and building projects including using Python.

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241014/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **498**!

A guide for "CircuitPython Polyphonic Audio FX" is [now available on the Adafruit Learn System](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-audio-fx/overview). Inspired by the original Adafruit Audio FX board, this version uses MP3 sound files & supports playback of more than one file simultaneously.

I also posted a Playground page detailing [how to easily install the new Python 3.13 on a Debian Linux system](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/jepler/pages/installing-python-3-13-using-uv) using a tool called "uv".

This week I worked on a guide for the [HSTX to DVI breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2350-22-pin-fpc-hstx-to-dvi-adapter). This breakout lets you use a 22-pin FPC with the Feather RP2350 HSTX to use the HSTX pins to output graphics over DVI. Support is available for this with CircuitPython. I'm looking forward to using this feature in a project since the RP2350 is faster than the RP2040 and has more memory.
