## SPECIAL: Raspberry Pi Releases the New RP2350 Microcontroller and Pico 2 Board

[![Raspberry Pi Releases the New RP2350 Microcontroller and Pico 2 Board](../assets/20240812/20240812p2.jpg)](url)

Raspberry Pi has released a new microcontroller, the RP2350, last Thursday in conjunction with DEF CON 23 (the official badge uses the new chip). A new board was also released, the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. The RP2340 comes in two packages, one with 30 pins and one with 48 pins providing additional GPIO. The new chips use two Arm Cortex M33 cores + floating point unit and also have two RISC-V HAZARD3 cores (only one set usable at a time). The clock speed is bumped to 150 MHz but with the new architecture and floating point along with 3 PIO units. The speed is about double at stock clocks, while using less power. Besides Raspberry Pi Pico, there are over 30 boards announced at launch from a variety of vendors - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-2-our-new-5-microcontroller-board-on-sale-now/), [RP2350 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf) (PDF), [Pico 2 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-2-datasheet.pdf) (PDF)

## MicroPython and CircuitPython Support for the RP2350 Chip

[![MicroPython and CircuitPython Support](../assets/20240812/20240812love.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython on Friday released version [9.2.0-alpha.2350](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.0-alpha.2350) which includes preliminary support for the new Raspberry Pi RP2350 and minor fixes for other enhancements. MicroPython has a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/15619) (PR) to its codebase to support the RP2350.

[![CircuitPython](../assets/20240812/20240812cp9p.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

There are multiple security features in the new Raspberry Pi RP2350. These include glitch detectors, a redundancy coprocessor, secure boot, Arm TrustZone-M, debug protection, and OTP protections. There is also a $10,000 hacking challenge from Hextree.io if someone manages to hack the chip - [X Thread](https://x.com/ghidraninja/status/1821570157933912462).

The Open Source Hardware Association works to spread awareness and knowledge of open source practices. OSHWA is in a pickle! In the US where the not for profit is registered there is a law stating that one third of all income must be from the public. Wwhile they have been extremely lucky to have received government grants, if they don't have enough public contributions their status will be revoked. With a purchase of a tee/hoodie you'll be helping maintain their status and any additional funds raised will go right back into making cool things happen in the community - [Custom Ink](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/oshwa?side=front&type=2&zoom=false).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were six new boards added:

- [Feather RP2350](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_feather_rp2350/)
- [Metro RP2350](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_metro_rp2350/)
- [Pico 2](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico2/)
- [RP2350 Stamp](https://circuitpython.org/board/solderparty_rp2350_stamp/)
- [RP2350 Stamp XL](https://circuitpython.org/board/solderparty_rp2350_stamp_xl/)
- [RP2040-One](https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_rp2040_one/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **490**!

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I was on vacation most of the week before last. I'm continuing on the MicroPython v1.22 merge. I've fixed most of the test failures. When it's in good enough shape to merge, I'll take the PR out of draft mode, have it reviewed and merged, and then immediately start on the v1.23 merge.

**Melissa**

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been working on adding new features to the [CircuitPython Code Editor Beta Site](https://code-beta.circuitpython.org/) including handling multiple file operations, improved stability, and UI improvements. Feel free to give the beta site a try out and let us know what you think.

**Tim**

I've continued moving a few more libraries to Ruff while reviewing other PRs. I implemented the Formatter class for `Adafruit_Logging` library and added support for using a formatted timestamp in the log output. There was a bug causing it to log extra empty lines which I also submitted a fix for. I've started adding a function to test for intersection between `vectorio` shapes, in the PR currently it's been implemented for `Circle` and `Rectangle`, I am researching the geometry involved with an implementation for `Polygon`.

**Scott**

This week is [RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/) launch week! I've secretly been working on CircuitPython support off and on over the last few months. Most of what the RP2040 supports should *just work* thanks to the pico sdk. So, it'll be easy to upgrade to the faster CPU and double the RAM. RGBMatrix, USB host and sleep are still disabled. I'm sure we'll find more [issues](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arp235x) as hardware becomes available. Hopefully by the time you are reading this the [pull request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9490) has been merged in.
