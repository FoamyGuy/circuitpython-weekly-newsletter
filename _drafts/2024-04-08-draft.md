## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240408/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**Jeff**

I made enhancements to `floppyio` and `adafruit_floppy` to make it with better with the upcoming "floppsy" board. These changes are incompatible, so you'll need different code for 9.0.x and older vs the unstable version of CircuitPython.

**Scott**

This week I put together my talk about wirelessly programming CircuitPython for PyCascades 2024. Once done with that, I switched back to working on USB host FeatherWing support. I have it working on nRF and ESP currently. Hopefully I can get SAMD and RP2040 working with it as well.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a [guide for the new SHT4x Trinkey](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht4x-trinkey). This Trinkey form factor board has an SHT41 or SHT45 temperature and humidity sensor onboard. I had a lot of fun with the demos for this one. I wrote up two CPython examples. One logs data from the Trinkey to a .CSV file and the other one logs data to Adafruit IO. I had never used the desktop Python Adafruit IO API but it was really easy to get up and running.

## Upcoming Events
