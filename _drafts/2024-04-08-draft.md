We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.0.3 Released

[![CircuitPython 9.0.3 Released](../assets/20240408/20240408cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/04/04/circuitpython-9-0-3-released/)

CircuitPython 9.0.3 is the latest bugfix release of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release. The only changes to 9.0.3 from 9.0.2 are a fix for `AnalogIn` on Nordic nRF boards, and the addition of the Waveshare RP2040-GEEK board - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/04/04/circuitpython-9-0-3-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.0.3).

## Espressif Chip News

Back in our [January 10, 2023 issue](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/2023/01/10/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-micropython-on-lego-controllers-circuitpython-in-2023-survey-and-much-more-circuitpython-python-thepsf-micropython-raspberry_pi/), we discussed the new ESP32-C6 and ESP32-P4. Now the C6 is on the market and Espressif has more P4 news.

[![Adafruit ESP32-C6 Feather](../assets/20240408/20240408c6.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5933)

Adafruit has announced the Adafruit ESP32-C6 Feather, a C6 development board in the ubiquitous Feather form factor. It integrates 2.4 GHz WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5 (LE) and the 802.15.4 protocol. It brings the goodness you know from the low-cost C3 series and improves it with Zigbee/802.15.4 at 2.4Ghz. It could make for great Matter development hardware! There is also a BME280 temperature and humidity sensor to make an integrated sensor node - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5933).

## This Week's Python Streams

[![Python Streams](../assets/20240408/cccircuitpython.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Python on Hardware is all about building a cooperative ecosphere which allows contributions to be valued and to grow knowledge. Below are the streams within the last week focusing on the community.

**CircuitPython Deep Dive Stream**

[![Deep Dive](../assets/20240408/20240408deepdive.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epbn0SlKDNQ)

## Project of the Week: The `bitmapfilter` Library

[![The `bitmapfilter` Library](../assets/20240408/20240408bmp.gif)](https://mastodon.social/@todbot/112197138537048342)

There’s a neat new core library in CircuitPython by Tod Kurt: `bitmapfilter`. Originally designed for the PyCamera project, it’s got many useful operations for generative art. A demonstration: random circles bluring away. Note: it does require a fast processor like the ESP32-S3 - [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@todbot/112197138537048342).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added:

- [Maker Go ESP32C3 Supermini](https://circuitpython.org/board/makergo-esp32c3-supermini/)
- [Quartz64 Model A](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/quartz64_a/) (Blinka)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.3 this past week, to fix a problem with `AnalogIn` on Nordic nRF boards. I'm continuing to work on issues on the 9.x.x issue list.

**Melissa**

This past week, I've been working on updating Learn guides and their associated code. Some that I've updated include the [Magic Storybook with ChatGPT](https://learn.adafruit.com/magic-storybook-with-chatgpt) guide, the [Adafruit DPI Display Kippah](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dpi-display-kippah-ttl-tft) guide, and the [Adding a Real Time Clock to Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi) guide.

**Jeff**

I made enhancements to `floppyio` and `adafruit_floppy` to make it with better with the upcoming "floppsy" board. These changes are incompatible, so you'll need different code for 9.0.x and older vs the unstable version of CircuitPython.

**Scott**

This week I put together my talk about wirelessly programming CircuitPython for PyCascades 2024. Once done with that, I switched back to working on USB host FeatherWing support. I have it working on nRF and ESP currently. Hopefully I can get SAMD and RP2040 working with it as well.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a [guide for the new SHT4x Trinkey](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht4x-trinkey). This Trinkey form factor board has an SHT41 or SHT45 temperature and humidity sensor onboard. I had a lot of fun with the demos for this one. I wrote up two CPython examples. One logs data from the Trinkey to a .CSV file and the other one logs data to Adafruit IO. I had never used the desktop Python Adafruit IO API but it was really easy to get up and running.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240408/20240408weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
