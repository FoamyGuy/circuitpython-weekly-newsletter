Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! PyCon US 2023 is currently underway and I hope folks are having fun connecting with like minded folk. A new beta of CircuitPython is out with some cool features. And folks are working on MicroPython running alongside other apps on the Playdate handheld. Never a dull moment in the Python onn Hardware beat. And we only need two more subscribers for 11,000 - I'm crossing my fingers for that. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.1.0 Beta 2

[![CircuitPython 9.1.0 Beta 2](../assets/20240520/20240520cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/05/15/circuitpython-9-1-0-beta-2-released/)

CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.2, a beta for CircuitPython 9.1.0, is a new unstable release. This release has known bugs that will be addressed before 9.1.0 final. - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/05/15/circuitpython-9-1-0-beta-2-released/) and [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.1.0-beta.2).

## The Official Raspberry Pi 5 M.2 HAT+ Now Out

[![Raspberry Pi 5 M.2 HAT+](../assets/20240520/20240520pcie.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/m-2-hat-on-sale-now-for-12/)

The preannounced Raspberry Pi 5 M.2 HAT+ is now rolling out to official retailers at $12. It enables connection of M.2 M-key peripherals, such as NVMe drives and AI accelerators, to a Raspberry Pi 5. The HAT provides fast (up to 500 MB/s) data transfer to and from these peripherals. - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/m-2-hat-on-sale-now-for-12/). A review - [bret.dk](https://bret.dk/official-raspberry-pi-m-2-hat-review/).

> "A nice side-effect of launching of the M.2 HAT+ a bit later has been a profusion of third-party products. We want to make it easier to build high-quality PCIe accessories for Raspberry Pi 5, and so we’re publishing our [schematics](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/m2-hat-plus.html#schematics) as a reference design. You can also browse our [documentation for the M.2 HAT+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/m2-hat-plus.html).

## Late Breaking: MicroPython Ported to the Playdate

[![MicroPython Ported to the Playdate](../assets/20240520/20240520playdate.jpg)](https://x.com/matt_trentini/status/1791412984499351638)

Christian Walther ([GitHub](https://github.com/cwalther?tab=repositories), [X](https://x.com/isziaui)) has ported MicroPython to the Panic developed [Playdate](https://play.date/) handheld gaming device - [X](https://x.com/matt_trentini/status/1791412984499351638) and [GitHub Code](https://github.com/cwalther/pew-playdate).

The work is part of a port of [PewPew](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/) to Playdate - [Playdate dev forum](https://devforum.play.date/t/pewpew-python-games-on-playdate-wip/17379).

> "What I want is to embed MicroPython into a fully fledged Playdate application that can live alongside other Playdate games. Unlike Lua, MicroPython is not specifically made for that purpose, but it does have some provisions for it. While it doesn’t easily compile into a library, among its “ports” to different microcontrollers there is one named “embed” that is not for a specific microcontroller but spits out a bunch of .c and .h files as its build product that can then be added into the build system of any C project on any platform."

## Linux Kernel 6.9 Officially Released, This Is What’s New

[![Linux Kernel 6.9](../assets/20240520/20240520linux.jpg)](https://9to5linux.com/linux-kernel-6-9-officially-released-this-is-whats-new)

This release introduces Rust support on AArch64 (ARM64) architectures and support for the Intel FRED (Flexible Return and Event Delivery) mechanism - [9to5Linux](https://9to5linux.com/linux-kernel-6-9-officially-released-this-is-whats-new) and [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/13/linux_kernel_69_released/).

Linus Torvalds now favors the Ampere Arm chip over using an Apple Silicon MacBook for building Linux kernels — he says he's now doing more Arm64 Linux testing than ever - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/linus-torvalds-now-favors-arm-powered-ampere-chip-over-apple-silicon-mac-for-building-linux-kernels-says-the-more-powerful-system-is-why-hes-doing-more-arm64-linux-testing).

## microSD Cards for Single-Board Computers (SBC) - Their Days Are Numbered

[![microSD Cards for Single-Board Computers](../assets/20240520/20240520jeff.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/microsd-cards-sbc-days-are-numbered)

Jeff Geerling postulates that use of microSD cards' for SBCs like Raspberry Pi may be phased out. The speeds obtained by PCIe drives are faster and the reliability of the storage is much higher - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/microsd-cards-sbc-days-are-numbered) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYN3ub8Qb_I).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added:

- [TRRS Trinkey](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_trrs_trinkey_m0/)
- [Pixel Trinkey](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_pixel_trinkey_m0/)

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.2 last week to catch up on all the changes that have been going on, and to have some new boards be included in a labeled release.

I reworked the socket retry logic in the `ConnectionManager` library, to make sure to release sockets when the code was running out of RAM. Now SSL sockets are working much better on ESP32-S2. There is still an issue with SSL server sockets causing memory errors in some cases, and I'm going to look at that as well.

**Jeff**

I've been at PyCon in Pittsburgh for the past few days, and yesterday I delivered my talk "Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython". Thanks to all those who attended! Sometime in the future the video & slides should become available.

**Scott**

Last week I was on vacation. My Dad and I did a road trip down to Goblin Valley State Park in Utah.

This week I've gotten caught up and I'm picking back up my work to enable BLE GATT servers support on Espressif chips. My first goal is to get the continuous integration builds succeeding so folks can test it more easily. After that, I'll be bug hunting!

**Liz**

This week I worked on a few product guides. The first was the [S-35710 low power timer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-s-35710-low-power-wake-up-timer-breakout). This breakout lets you use a watchdog timer over I2C. I wrote a simple CircuitPython driver to interface with it. The next one was a [breakout adapter for a SEN54 or SEN55 sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sen54-or-sen55-adapter-breakout). These sensors use a JST GH connector, so this breakout makes the wiring a lot easier. Sensirion has their own libraries for Arduino and Python, so I was able to use those for the demos. 

Finally, the last new product guide for this week was the [555 STEMMA breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-555-pwm-output-stemma). This breakout has the famous 555 timer on it paired with a 74HC1G04 buffer for a square wave output with trimmer pot adjustable frequency.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240520/20240520weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
