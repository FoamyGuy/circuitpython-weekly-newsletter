Right now there are two ways to use te new Rp2350, via the C++ workflow, and using a preview of the latest MicroPython firmware. Tom's Hardware shows how to use the latest MicroPython firmware for RISC-V to demonstrate that it is as easy as the version of MicroPython used for the Arm CPU - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-pico/how-to-install-micropython-for-risc-v-on-the-raspberry-pi-pico-2).

## CircuitPython Building Open Source Businesses

[![CircuitPython building open source businesses](../assets/20240923/20240923bus.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/17/circuitpython-building-open-source-businesses/)

Adafruit loves that the Maker community has embraced CircuitPython, for hobby and business. Five years ago, arturo182 introduced the Serpente board, a CircuitPython SAMD21 board in a Digispark form factor. His open source company, Solder Party, now makes a wide range of products. Another example is KMK firmware for keyboards. Based on CircuitPython, it powers a wide range of home build keyboards and innovative products for sale - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/09/17/circuitpython-building-open-source-businesses/).

[![Measuring beer colour](../assets/20240923/20240923beer.jpg)](https://gerritniezen.com/measuring-beer-colour-with-an-open-source-colorimeter)

Gerrit Niezen has built colorimeter using the Open Colorimeter design by [IO Rodeo](https://blog.iorodeo.com/beer-color-srm/). A colorimeter is a scientific instrument used to measure the intensity of a color in a solution. The Open Colorimeter consists of an Adafruit TSL2591 Light Sensor and an Adafruit PyBadge inside a 3D printed enclosure. The light sensor is attached to a 3D printed cuvette holder, with a white LED light board attached to the other side - [Gerrit Niezen](https://gerritniezen.com/measuring-beer-colour-with-an-open-source-colorimeter).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240923/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

**Jeff**

I've been going module by module to make sure the functionality of the RP2350 chip, particularly on the Pico 2, is working.

One problem I found and resolved actually affected the RP2040 as well: the timing of neopixel data in adafruit_neopxl8 was not quite right, with all pulses being somewhat shorter than they should have been. This is now fixed and an updated version of the lib will likely be released shortly.

**Scott**

This week I've fixed a number of issues on the ESP32 series of chips and one on nRF. The fixes are in 9.1.4 and 9.2.0-beta.0. Thanks to Dan for releasing those. I'm finally back to working on CircuitMatter. I starting to work on commissioning and am currently figuring out how to encrypt my reply so the commissioner can decrypt it.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a few product guides. The first is for the [Adafruit DS2482S-800 8 Channel I2C to 1-Wire Bus Adapter](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds2482s-800-8-channel-i2c-to-1-wire-bus-adapter). This breakout lets you use up to 8 1-Wire sensors over I2C and intead of having to know the ROM address of the sensors, you can call them out by channel. I updated the CircuitPython library to be able to handle passing a ROM address or channel number to the DS18B20 temperature function.

I have also been working on the Feather RP2350 guide. I have a few more pages to take care of now that Arduino support has been merged into the Philhower Arduino BSP but it should be wrapped up and ready to show off next week.

I have also been using the new itsaSnap iOS app with Apple Shortcuts. This lets you use your phone to send data to Adafruit IO. I've been having a lot of fun working with shortcuts and have a few projects ideas that I'm starting to work on. If you want a sample of what you can do, check out [Trevor's new weather display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/itsasnap-daily-weather-forecast-board). It uses CircuitPython on a Matrix Portal S3 with Apple Shortcuts and itsaSnap to send weather data from iOS to Adafruit IO and then display the data on the RGB matrix. I think this is a really cool use of itsaSnap because usually getting weather data can be cumbersome with API requests and API keys.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240923/20240923weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
