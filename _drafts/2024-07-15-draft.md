## Arduino Embraces Maker I2C Bus Standard Connections

[![Arduino Embraces Maker I2C Bus Standard Connections](../assets/20240715/20240715arduino.jpg)]([url](https://blog.arduino.cc/2024/07/11/kickstart-your-tech-journey-with-the-new-arduino-plug-and-make-kit/))

Arduino has joined with SparkFun, Adafruit, and others in embracing a standard connector for I2C bus connections. Called [Qwiic by SparkFun and Stemma QT by Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-stemma/blob/master/awesome-stemma-qt.md), this allows for solderless connections to dozens of compatible boards including sensors, indicators and controls. Dubbed Modulino® by Arduino, there are a number of I2C boards coming out - [Arduino Blog](https://blog.arduino.cc/2024/07/11/kickstart-your-tech-journey-with-the-new-arduino-plug-and-make-kit/).

## Project of the Week: Boris Puts Two Raspberry Pis to Work in an Industrial Home Assistant Control Panel

[![Industrial Home Assistant Control Panel](../assets/20240715/20240715potw.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/boris-puts-two-raspberry-pis-to-work-in-this-impressively-industrial-home-assistant-control-panel-29de27cc7cd3)

A high-tech panel for a Home Assistant installation is on tap this week. It uses two Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and some Adafruit I2C IO expanders to accomodate all the external inputs and outputs. It's tied together on the panel with Python running on the Pis - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/boris-puts-two-raspberry-pis-to-work-in-this-impressively-industrial-home-assistant-control-panel-29de27cc7cd3) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Oz87wOJSQm8).

> "I modeled this after modern commercial jetliner cockpits, and also a little on nuclear power plant control rooms," Boris explains of the control panel's aesthetics.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240715/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.1.0 last Wednesday. Thanks to everyone who worked on this release for the past several months.

Next I'm going to work on catching us up to the latest MicroPython changes. We last merged MicroPython v1.20. MicroPython most recently released v1.23. We merge the versions one at a time to understand the merges more easily and make them smaller.

**Melissa**

This past week, I updated the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and fixed the USB Workflow to get it into a working state. In the process, I found that the [REPL JS library](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-repl-js) will need to be updated to use Raw mode rather than Raw Paste mode, which will fix some of the weird issues that I've been seeing. I will also need to make some structural changes and will continue to working on it over the next week or so.

**Tim**

[![Tim](../assets/20240715/20240715tim.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

text.

**Jeff**

I published a guide on the Adafruit Learning System: [MP3 Playback with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/mp3-playback-with-circuitpython). This details MP3 streaming, recently added in the latest development version of CircuitPython, as well as bringing together other information about using the audiomp3 module that was previously spread across multiple guides.

**Scott**

This week I'm digging into the Matter IoT specification and planning to implement a portion of it in CircuitPython. There is an open SDK written in C++ but it is quite large and complex. So, I'm going to attempt to re-implement the core bits in Python instead. It is built on top of IPv6 TCP and UDP so it shouldn't require many changes internal to CircuitPython.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a product guide for the [IR Remote Transceiver](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-infrared-ir-remote-transceiver). This breakout lets you send and receive IR remote signals. It has examples for both Arduino and CircuitPython.

I also worked on testing the Vindie S2 board. I have a spreadsheet where I can keep track of the tests I've tried and what's working vs. not working in CircuitPython and Arduino. One thing that we'll need to change on the next hardware revision is the USB port. The one we chose is mechanically strong but has slightly too much overhang on the edge, so it conflicts with the case. I found a port that has data pins without any extra mounting hardware. This seems to be rare for vertical USB C ports. I designed up a quick breakout for this new port. That should be arriving in the next few days.

## Upcoming Events

[![MicroPython Meetup](../assets/20240701/20240701mp.png)](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)
