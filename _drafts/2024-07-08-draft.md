## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240708/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've finished fixing BLE bugs for now for CircuitPython 9.1.0, and am looking at hte remaining issues. I released CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.4 last Wednesday for further testing. It has the BLE functionality we wanted to provide: BLE central and peripheral, and bonding and pairing. Thanks to Scott for finishing the implementation.

**Tim**

**Jeff**

I'm working on a guide for MP3 playback that will cover the recently added ability to stream MP3s directly from a web server on most Espressif-family WiFi MCUs with PSRAM, including ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3.

**Scott**

This is a short week for me. I'm sick too so I'm not getting a ton done. However, I've loaded the [Matter specification PDF](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) onto my eink tablet to read through it. I'm excited to dive back into home automation.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a product guide for the new [Adafruit Feather RP2040 Adalogger](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-adalogger). This is another RP2040 “bones” board with a microSD card slot on the back. This makes it easy to add datalogging or removable storage to your project. The guide has pages for pinouts, power management, CircuitPython, Arduino, factory reset and resources for download.
