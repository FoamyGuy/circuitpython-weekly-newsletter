Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! July 4th came in with a bang! Not the US fireworks or the British election but a quiet roar from the folks at Raspberry Pi who released a new version of Pi OS. And speaking of new releases, CircuitPython 9.1 is very close with a new beta. I hear Bluetooth for ESP32-S3 is getting love. PyCon Europe is this week, it should be fabulous and catch the released videos from PyCon US. And much more as usual for your perusal. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

## 10 Best Operating Systems for Raspberry Pi 5

[![10 best operating systems for Raspberry Pi 5](../assets/20240708/20240708os.jpg)](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-operating-systems-for-raspberry-pi-5/)

Over the years, Raspberry Pi boards have taken over the DIY projects landscape and have become synonymous with the term SBC. But despite their standalone nature, one still needs an operating system to drive every mainline entry in the Raspberry Pi family. Fortunately, there are a lot to choose from, as these tiny boards are compatible with a good number of operating systems. Having spent a long time tinkering with a RPi 5, here are ten of XDA's favorite OSes you may use on the latest member of the popular Pi family - [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-operating-systems-for-raspberry-pi-5/).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I've finished fixing BLE bugs for now for CircuitPython 9.1.0, and am looking at hte remaining issues. I released CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.4 last Wednesday for further testing. It has the BLE functionality we wanted to provide: BLE central and peripheral, and bonding and pairing. Thanks to Scott for finishing the implementation.

**Jeff**

I'm working on a guide for MP3 playback that will cover the recently added ability to stream MP3s directly from a web server on most Espressif-family WiFi MCUs with PSRAM, including ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3.

**Scott**

This is a short week for me. I'm sick too so I'm not getting a ton done. However, I've loaded the [Matter specification PDF](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) onto my eink tablet to read through it. I'm excited to dive back into home automation.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a product guide for the new [Adafruit Feather RP2040 Adalogger](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-adalogger). This is another RP2040 “bones” board with a microSD card slot on the back. This makes it easy to add datalogging or removable storage to your project. The guide has pages for pinouts, power management, CircuitPython, Arduino, factory reset and resources for download.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240708/20240708weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
