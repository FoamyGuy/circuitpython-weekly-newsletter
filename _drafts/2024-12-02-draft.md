Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! A great deal has happened this week! Raspberry Pi has released the long anticipated Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W **and** the Compute Module 5. And video talks from PyCon Australia 2024 are online and include informative discussions of MicroPython. Please note this issue is a bit abbreviated, your editor was sick and took some doctor ordered rest. But you cannot keep a good Maker down completely. Happy Cyber Monday! - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.24.1 is Out

## Teaching Digital Technologies in Australian Schools with Python and the Kookaberry

[![Teaching Digital Technologies in Australian schools with Python and the Kookaberry](../assets/20241202/20241202dam.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2YIHYDbG8)

Damien George (MicroPython inventor) and Julian Dinsdale's talk at PyCon AU 2024 - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2YIHYDbG8).

> "There are around 6,200 primary schools around Australia, and the curriculum has a requirement to teach Digital Technologies, which includes a coding portion.  There are many challenges here, not least which is enabling the approximately 150,000 primary school teachers with the skills and resources to teach programming to young students.  The AustSTEM foundation was set up to assist in this area, and developed a MicroPython based learning platform, which consists of a pocket-sized computing device that integrates with a web-based coding and teaching environment. In this talk we will discuss this teaching platform, how it can help students transition from block-based programming to textual coding, and show some of the successes we have had so far in Australian classrooms"

## Feather Takes Flight on the SparkFun Thing Plus with an RP2350 Microcontroller

[![SparkFun Thing Plus](../assets/20241202/20241202sf.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25134)

SparkFun's latest [Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943) soars high! The SparkFun RP2350 Thing Plus is a dynamic and powerful wireless development platform in the Thing Plus form factor. This lightweight powerhouse spreads its wings with a RP2350 microcontroller from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This board includes their radio module for single-band 2.4 GHz WiFi 4 (802.11n) and Bluetooth® 5.2, along with standard hardware components found on all Thing Plus Boards. This includes on-board Lithium Ion (LiPo) battery charging and fuel gauge circuits, µSD card socket, Qwiic connector, and the Thing Plus pinout (Feather-footprint, & Feather pinout, ensuring compatibility with the Feather ecosystem), and allowing use of the RP2350 Thing Plus in a wide variety of both local and remote applications.

It looks like this could be a Feather in your project’s cap! Ready to ruffle some Feathers? Dive into your next project and let your ideas fly to new heights with this new Feather :) - [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25134).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added:

- [Bradán Lane STUDIO Coin M0](https://circuitpython.org/board/bradanlanestudio_coin_m0/)
- [Pico 2 W](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico2_w/)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20241202/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **506**!

**Updated Libraries**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

  * [adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MiniMQTT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MiniMQTT)
  * [adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CharLCD](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CharLCD)
  * [adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Dash_Dis](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Dash_Dis)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I did some refactoring in the CircuitMatter library to isolate the calls to the `ecdsa` library, so that its functionality can be replaced with something else when running CircuitMatter on CircuitPython.

**Tim**

I fixed an issue with filtering boards on circuitpython.org that was caused by my changes to search from last week. I've continued working through library issues, this week I added docstrings, type annotations, examples to various libraries and submitted a timeout fix for MiniMQTT. I finished the BlueSky project guide, however it may get a re-visit if I can work through some issues with the TFT display. 

**Jeff**

This week I implemented a DOS floppy archiver for the Floppsy board. With just one button press, it archives DOS floppies in any of the 4 common formats (360k, 720k, 1.2M and 1.44M) into IMG files on an SD card.

**Scott**

I'm back from my first short stretch of paternity leave this week. The baby and my wife are doing well. We're sleep deprived but that's how it goes with newborns.

I've gotten caught up on email and have been working on the ESP32-P4 support. TinyUSB added support after my initial work so I'm trying to get USB going. I plan on helping bring CircuitMatter to CircuitPython with Dan. I'm also brainstorming goals for CircuitPython in 2025. I'll be out on more paternity leave next year so we need to prioritize my time before then. We'll do #CircuitPython2025 in the New Year to hear from our community.
