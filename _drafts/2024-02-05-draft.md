Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! No sooner had I predicted the first beta for CircuitPython, it was released. Help the team find any issues by trying it now. Can you remember the difference between Espressif chips? Download a handy chart and never struggle again. If you want to use TensorFlow Lite on an RP2040 dual core, a new version provides that. And much, much more in this week's edition. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.0.0 Beta 0 Released

[![CircuitPython 9.0.0 Beta 0 Released](../assets/20240205/20240205cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/01/27/circuitpython-9-0-0-beta-0-released/)

CircuitPython 9.0.0-beta.0, a beta release for 9.0.0, is now available and is the new unstable release.

* Add `jpegio` JPEG decoder support.
* Add `bitmapfilter` image manipulation.
* Add `repl.py`, which runs just before the REPL starts up.
* Add `OrderedDict.move_to_end()`.
* Add `synthio.Synthesizer.note_state`.
* Add `warnings` module, similar to what is in CPython.
* Add `locale.getlocale()`.
* Add I2S MCLK support on Espressif.
* Add mDNS TXT record support.
* Add `synthio.Note` `.loop_start` and `.loop_end` properties.
* Allow signed amplitude in `synthio`.
* HID can wake up sleeping host computer.

## Raspberry Pi and Python Powers First Driverless Car in Formula SAE Brazil Competition

[![Driverless Car in Formula SAE Brazil](../assets/20240205/20240205car.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-powers-first-driverless-car-in-formula-sae-brazil-competition/)

A Raspberry Pi running Python powers the first driverless car in Formula SAE Brazil competition. Team Ampera pushed through various prototypes before creating a Raspberry Pi-powered car capable of navigating the Formula SAE Brazil track completely autonomously - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-powers-first-driverless-car-in-formula-sae-brazil-competition/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/KMtS09EsBOo).

> "Python algorithms (are used) to build a map of the track. These algorithms don’t just calculate the best path to follow; they also determine control actions, such as steering and acceleration, and send these suggestions to the car’s electronic control unit (ECU)."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there was another board added:

- [EDU PICO for Pico W](https://circuitpython.org/board/cytron_edu_pico_w/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Melissa**

This past week, I finally wrapped up my fixes for the displays which now run on Bookworm. This includes creating my first pull request to Raspberry Pi Linux to fix up some of the device tree overlays and add additional functionality, which has been merged in. It should be part of the next release of Bookworm and once it is, we can simplify the installer scripts. With the displays now working, I'm going through and testing and updating the learn guides which we had to add warnings to when Bookworm was initially released.

**Tim**

This week I tested a handful of PRs for MiniMQTT and Wiznet5k libraries. I've also begun working on a project for an upcoming guide that is a small text editor cyberdeck built from the Feather RP2040 USB Host and a TFT Feathering. I started with a project that Jeff published a few months back and have added a visible cursor to it that is drawn with `displayio` on the display so it can be seen there in addition to the serial console. Next up is getting the keyboard input working into the USB Host feather.

**Jeff**

I added an example in `Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyCamera` of all the features of the new `bitmapfilter` module, which was released as part of 9.0.0-beta.0 last week.

Well, almost all the features of `bitmapfilter`, because this week I also added support for "blend functions", similar to the layer blend functions in photo editing programs. There's one base function coded in C to perform a blend, while the mathematics of each specific blend mode are specified as Python functions (many are quite simple). Applying a blend function on a pair of 208x208 pixel images takes about 20ms on an ESP32-S3.

This code will be in the next beta, and the Memento PyCamera filter example has already been updated to show some blending modes.

**Scott**

A number of [fixes I made](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Atannewt) for CircuitPython 9.0.0 were merged this past week. I'm really trying to push us to where 9.0.0 is stable.

The SD card over BLE and WiFi work was merged and folks have been hitting the behavior change of `storage.mount()`. With 9.0.0 you'll need to make a directory where you want to mount another file system. So, for example, you'll need to make a `sd` directory on the CIRCUITPY drive in order to mount to `/sd` from CircuitPython code.

Lastly, I've wrapped up #CircuitPython2024 this week. Thanks to [everyone who posted their ideas](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/circuitpython2024/).

**Liz**

This past week I worked on the [CAN Bus BFF guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-can-bus-bff). This breakout lets you use CAN Bus with a QT Py form factor board. I've worked on a few CAN Bus products in the past year and this guide features a nice demo written by Ladyada that sends CAN messages every time you rotate a rotary encoder.
