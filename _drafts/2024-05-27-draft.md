## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240527/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.5 and CircuitPython 9.1.0-beta.3 last week. 9.0.5 caught up on some minor fixes. 9.1.0-beta.3 includes the more complete Espressif BLE implementation that Scott has been working on.

Socket error recovery in our libraries has been improved thanks to our community members, especially Justin. I'm now trying to reproduce various network errors that have been reported, to see if they are still present when using the latest versions of everything. 

**Melissa**

I've been out sick a bunch during the past couple of weeks, so I didn't get a chance to put in an update in last week's newsletter. Otherwise, I've been working on an update to the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) to allow easier file operations for USB connected devices via the REPL. Currently it works on USB devices via the FileSystem API, but this requires a lot of things to be done by the user to make it work correctly and this will simplify things by only requiring a serial connection.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on Circup, there are a few small issues caused by the recent refactoring that I'm fixing. I've also been writing new and updated documentation pages in the Circup learn guide that detail all of it's features, many of which are newer and weren't documented in the guide yet. Tangential to circup I'm also working on a CLI tool for managing files on Circuitpython devices via web workflow.

**Jeff**

**Scott**

This week I've started working on ESP BLE bonding support. However, I've been a bit distracted by my Python-based build system for embedded C (like CircuitPython.) My hope is to make it easier to maintain and refactor the build logic for CircuitPython.

**Liz**

This week I wrote up a guide for the [Tripler PiCowbell](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-proto-tripler-picowbell). This lets you use two PiCowbells with a Pico. It also has a JST PH port for battery power, a STEMMA QT port and an EYESPI port for easily using an SPI display. Personally, I'm very excited about the EYESPI port. EYESPI has become one of my favorite features on Adafruit hardware.

I also wrote some CircuitPython code for the [USB Rotary Media Dial project](https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-rotary-media-dial) This was a collab with Noe. He wanted to remake the [original media dial project](https://learn.adafruit.com/media-dial) to use a seesaw rotary encoder, which greatly simplifies the code and the assembly. We added variables at the top of the code to make it easy for folks to customize the HID shortcuts. We also made use of the long press and short press count features in the [adafruit_debouncer library](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/debouncer/en/latest/api.html#adafruit_debouncer.Button).
