## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240129/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

This past week Scott and I did some pair debugging and were able to fix a longstanding issue that made some operations not work correctly when you subclassed built-in dict type.

A user encountered another core language problem. I found it was already reported to MicroPython, and is not easy to fix without possibly causing an mpy version change, so we'll await a fix from upstream.

**Melissa**

This past week, I've been working on getting the PiTFT Displays working on the Raspberry Pi 5 with Bookworm. So far, the 2.2" PiTFT has been updated and works. I'm still struggling with getting the touch rotation to work for the 2.8" capacitive and resistive touchscreens, but hopefully that will be worked out soon.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on the 1D Chomper game and Learn Guide. I did a load of cleaning up and commenting the code. I also set up the light box to take some clean photos for the guide and recorded a quick look introduction video for the project. 

**Jeff**

**Scott**

This past week has been co-opted by a daycare flu. Ari got it and then I got it a few days later. So, I haven't done as much as I would have liked. My main work is [accessing the SD card over WiFi and BLE](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8699). The PR is ready and will hopefully get merged in the next few days. Next, I'm finishing up my [#CircuitPython2024](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/01/01/circuitpython-in-2024-circuitpython2024-python-circuitpython/) post. After that, I'll be heads down on bug fixing for the 9.0 release. I'd love to get 9.0.0 released in February (just like 8.0.0 was released last February.)

**Liz**

This week I published the [Qualia S3 Compass project](https://learn.adafruit.com/qualia-s3-compass). I used a Qualia S3 with a 2.1 inch round display and a 9-DoF sensor to create a working compass. I learned a lot working on this project, since first of all I had never really used a compass, but there was a lot of math involved in calculating the compass heading properly and displaying it in two different ways on the round display. I'd like to extend a hug report to community member Gamblor21, whose [AHRS CircuitPython library](https://github.com/gamblor21/Gamblor21_CircuitPython_AHRS) in the community bundle was extremely helpful for this project. I also used [rotozoom](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/bitmaptools/index.html#bitmaptools.rotozoom) from the built-in bitmaptools for the first time and once I understood how to use it properly, it was a game changer. I look forward to using it in future projects.
