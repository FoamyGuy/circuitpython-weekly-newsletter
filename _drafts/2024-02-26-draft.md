Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This week has been a cornucopia of news! Enough for two weeks, but I'm not holding back. A rare new version of MicroPython is out with bug fixes. Similarly CircuitPython 9.0.0 Beta 2 is out and an important upgrade for MEMENTO camera owners. More Raspberry Pi news (of course) as well as knowing Python is rather a good thing in the job market. Some fabulous projects and much more, this week. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.22.2 Released

[![MicroPython v1.22.2 Released](../assets/20240226/20240226mp.png)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.22.2)

MicroPython was just updated. Changes are described as a "patch release for rp2 DMA, UART and BLE, esp32 BLE, renesas-ra I2C" - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.22.2).

## CircuitPython 9.0.0-beta.2 Released with Urge to Update for MEMENTO

[![CircuitPython 9.0.0-beta.2 Released](../assets/20240226/20240226cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/19/circuitpython-9-0-0-beta-2-released/)

CircuitPython 9.0.0-beta.2, a beta release for 9.0.0 is the new unstable release. This release has known bugs that will be addressed before 9.0.0 final - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/19/circuitpython-9-0-0-beta-2-released/) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.0.0-beta.2).

> [Note for MEMENTO Camera Board users](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/21/memento-camera-board-users-update-circuitpython-to-9-0-0-beta-2-or-later/): This release contains an important fix for MEMENTO. If you originally installed a version of CircuitPython older than 9.0.0-beta.2 on your board, your CIRCUITPY drive thinks it is larger than it really is. **This can cause crashes.** To fix this, back up what is on your drive, install CircuitPython 9.0.0-beta.2 or later, and then erase and reformat CIRCUITPY by running two commands in the REPL.

## Considerations for a Long-Running Raspberry

[![Considerations for a long-running Raspberry](../assets/20240226/20240226long.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/22/considerations-for-a-long-running-raspberry-pi-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/)

Keeping a Raspberry Pi online and working with zero intervention for weeks, months, or years is somewhat of an art form. Several classes of things can go wrong, and you need to consider how your Pi will recover from each of them - [chris dzombak](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2023/12/Considerations-for-a-long-running-Raspberry-Pi.html) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/02/22/considerations-for-a-long-running-raspberry-pi-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/).

## Making a Ring Mouse With Buttons and Wheel

[![Making a Ring Mouse](../assets/20240226/20240226rings.jpg)](https://www.instructables.com/Ring-With-Mouse-Buttons-Wheel/?s=03)

These rings are HID mouse controllers with 4 buttons each. There buttons are: left mouse click, right mouse click, wheel up and wheel down. They connect to a PC via Bluetooth. The controller works as a ring on ones hand, one is designed as left handed and one right. The device is based on a Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 microcontroller programmed in CircuitPython - [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Ring-With-Mouse-Buttons-Wheel/?s=03) and [GitHub](https://github.com/rafgaj/Mouse-buttons-and-wheel/tree/main).

[![Raspberry Pi 5 vs 4: Is the extra power worth the cost?](../assets/20240226/20240226cost.jpg)](https://www.pocket-lint.com/raspberry-pi-5-vs-4/)

There are pros and cons to both the Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi 4, depending on how you plan to use your mini computer. To figure out which is best for different purposes, Pocket-lint puts Pi 5 and 4 computers to the test, comparing their performance and capabilities in different situations - [Pocket-lint](https://www.pocket-lint.com/raspberry-pi-5-vs-4/).

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.10, 9.0.0-beta.1, and then 9.0.0-beta.2 in the past week. 9.0.0-beta.2 fixes an issue with the MEMENTO CIRCUITPY filesystem. Thanks to everyone who worked on this: we had a quick solution. The PyCamera library will now notice if you have not updated and tell you what to do.

I'm now working on some remaining issues with the nRF port for 9.0.0.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20240226/20240226melissa.jpg)](https://circuitPython.org/)

This past week, I made some progress with `Pi_Eyes` and now have it successfully retrieving and saving the desktop as an image. This is done in C and the idea is to have it constantly retrieve the image, shrink it, and display it across 2 displays.

I also update the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/) so that it works with some changes made in CircuitPython 9 to Web Workflow. Previously it was failing to connect. Additional improvements are planned as well.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on a demo for the MEMENTO that adds decorative overlays on top of the photos that it takes. This required figuring out the correct colorspace conversions and modifying the `adafruit_bitmapsaver` library to support `ColorConverter` in addition to `Palette` for getting color information to save. I've submitted a PR with some of the most basic usage of this functionality and am working on a more advanced version that allows modifying the overlay position with the D pad.

**Jeff**

I've gotten back into retro floppy disk coding. The current goal is to implement MFM writing so that it is possible to both read and write from a real DOS-formatted floppy disk connected to a modern PC through a device like the Adafruit Floppsy. This work will appear first for Arduino but might be ported to CircuitPython later if it turns out to be feasible.

**Scott**

This week I've continued squishing bugs for 9.0.0. I made socket reuse work like CPython. I fixed ctrl-c issues on iMX RT. I also fixed UART RX issues on iMX RT. I improved NeoPixel transmission on ESP32. Now I'm looking at a hard crash on SAMD21 when using `PulseIn`.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the new [NeoRGB breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neorgb-stemma). This breakout lets you send NeoPixel-compatible signals to an analog RGB strip. I've dealt with using PWM on the three red, green and blue channels before and being able to send NeoPixel data with the built-in animations was really cool. I hope to do a project with it at some point.
