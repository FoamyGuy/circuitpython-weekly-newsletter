Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Documentation and software supporting the new Raspberry Pi 5 are both finally coming out. And hardware is also getting into folks' hands. There are some changes happening in the newsletter as I'm looking to make it more focused to you, the reader. Comments are welcome at cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.0.0 Alpha Is Out With New Features

[![CircuitPython 9.0.0 Alpha](../assets/20231030/CP9temp.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/27/circuitpython-9-0-0-alpha-2-released/)

CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.2, an alpha release for 9.0.0 has been released. Version 9 adds significant capabilities over Version 8 - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/10/27/circuitpython-9-0-0-alpha-2-released/) and release notes - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.0.0-alpha.2).

**Notable changes to 9.0.0**
* Merge updates from MicroPython v1.19.1, v1.20.0, and v1.21.0.
* Espressif: update to ESP-IDF v5.1.
* Remove 8.x.x deprecations: `displayio.*.show()`, `I2CPeripheral`: now `I2CTarget`.
* Add `repl.py`, which runs just before the REPL starts up.
* Add `OrderedDict.move_to_end()`.
* Add `synthio.Synthesizer.note_state`.
* Further USB host support, on i.MX and RP2040.

## The CircuitPython Blinka Python Compatability Layer Now Supports Raspberry Pi 5

[![Blinka Python Now Supports Raspberry Pi 5](../assets/20231030/20231030blinka.jpg)](https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/)

The CircuitPython Blinka Python compatability layer now supports Raspberry Pi 5. Create CircuitPython programs for Raspberry Pi and other Single Board Computers (SBCs) running Python. Raspberry Pi 5 support added via the latest Pi 5 compatible version of libgpiod - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-Blinka/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/releases/tag/8.24.0).

## Using Python Virtual Environments on Raspberry Pi

[![Python venv](../assets/20231030/20231030venv.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi)

Starting with the October 10, 2023 Bookworm release of the Raspberry Pi OS, the use of Python Virtual Environments (venv) when pip installing packages is required. No more sudo pip. This will break things and require learning new things. This change is being done to protect the system level Python installation. This is not a new issue and using venv has long been the recommended solution. We've just been slow to adopt this on Raspberry Pi boards. Learn more - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi).

## Project of the Week: A QR Code Menu Printer

[![QR Code Menu Printer](../assets/20231030/20231030potw.jpg)](https://hackaday.io/project/193322-a-la-qrte-qr-code-menu-printer)

A LA QRTE is a portable, combination scanner/printer for converting QR code menus into physical copies.

It runs on a rechargeable 12V battery and uses a Tiny Code Reader (from Useful Sensors) for QR scanning. It runs on a Seeed Studio XIAO Esp-32 S3 to read from the scanner, communicate with the backend, and drive the thermal printer module, talking to a web server written in CircuitPython that fetches menus, scrapes the text, feeds it to ChatGPT, and formats the final result - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/193322-a-la-qrte-qr-code-menu-printer), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dytFj5Iw208) and [GitHub](https://github.com/dupontgu/a-la-qrte).

AWG is a 2 independent channel arbitrary waveform generator using a Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython - [X](https://twitter.com/bradanlane/status/1717711938602377697) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bradanlane/awg2chan).

> An 'arbitrary waveform generator' or AWG is able to generate a range of waveforms. This code uses the Raspberry Pi PICO and its PIO, state machines, and DMA to
provide two completely independent waveforms. Each waveform generates values between 0v and VCC (3.3V on the PICO). It is possible to add a combination of voltage dividers and an opamp to provide larger or smaller ranges or make the output a +/- range.

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Scott and I finished merging MicroPython v1.21.0 into CircuitPython. We are now caught up with the latest MicroPython release.

I am debugging a certificate issue with NINA-FW, which is the ESP32 fimrware used on AirLift boards. It does not handle ECDSA certificate chains properly. Interestingly, we discovered that rolling back to a very old version of NINA-FW does work, so we need to see what has changed that causes the regression.

By the time you read this, we will probably have released CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.2, the first published release of the 9.0.0 series. Alpha.0 and alpha.1 were not released: they were just labels to mark significant points. But they were using other versions of the .mpy format, and we wanted all 9.0.0 releases to use the same format.

**Melissa**

This past week I updated Blinka to run on the Raspberry Pi 5. I used `libgpiod` as the underlying library and added support for pullups and pulldowns which previously was not working.

**Tim**

This week I tested some changes to the core `displayio` API on a few different types of displays. I also worked to re-create an issue a user is having with the Cleveland art PyPortal project. After testing many versions of nina-firmware for the co-processor it's been determined that an old version perhaps shipped on the device originally is able to work successfully, but newer ones aren't. While investigating that issue I found an unrelated problem that `BitmapLabel` can have with certain fonts and text values shown, I'm working now on a fix for that issue.

**Scott**

This week Dan and I got version 1.21 of MicroPython merged into CircuitPython main, which will be released as 9.0. This is a big milestone because it's one of the last major changes to do on it. (The ESP-IDF has already been updated to 5.1 from 4.4.) I've also done all of the breaking changes and am working to add the ability to warn when APIs will be broken in the future. The last major thing on my list is reworking CircuitPython to grow it's heap automatically and simplify our ability to allocate memory to use outside the VM. 9.0.0 alphas will start being released soon!

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a fun collaboration with Noe. He designed a case for the HUSB238 breakout, which lets you request different voltages from a USB PD power supply aka turn your devices that use a wall wart into USB C devices. I had a MIDI keyboard that used a 12V wall wart that had a very short cable, so I wanted to make it USB C. This became the use case that we showed in the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/case-for-husb238) and in the [project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2d8Vo-EKs). I added a page to the guide documenting how to check your wall wart supply for the information needed to convert it to USB C with the HUSB238. 

## Upcoming Events!
