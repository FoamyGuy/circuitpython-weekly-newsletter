## Using Python Virtual Environments on Raspberry Pi

[![Python venv](../assets/20231030/20231030venv.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi)

Starting with the October 10, 2023 Bookworm release of the Raspberry Pi OS, the use of Python Virtual Environments (venv) when pip installing packages is required. No more sudo pip. This will break things and require learning new things. This change is being done to protect the system level Python installation. This is not a new issue and using venv has long been the recommended solution. We've just been slow to adopt this on Raspberry Pi boards. Learn more - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/python-virtual-environment-usage-on-raspberry-pi).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

This week I tested some changes to the core `displayio` API on a few different types of displays. I also worked to re-create an issue a user is having with the Cleveland art PyPortal project. After testing many versions of nina-firmware for the co-processor it's been determined that an old version perhaps shipped on the device originally is able to work successfully, but newer ones aren't. While investigating that issue I found an unrelated problem that `BitmapLabel` can have with certain fonts and text values shown, I'm working now on a fix for that issue.

**Scott**

This week Dan and I got version 1.21 of MicroPython merged into CircuitPython main, which will be released as 9.0. This is a big milestone because it's one of the last major changes to do on it. (The ESP-IDF has already been updated to 5.1 from 4.4.) I've also done all of the breaking changes and am working to add the ability to warn when APIs will be broken in the future. The last major thing on my list is reworking CircuitPython to grow it's heap automatically and simplify our ability to allocate memory to use outside the VM. 9.0.0 alphas will start being released soon!

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a fun collaboration with Noe. He designed a case for the HUSB238 breakout, which lets you request different voltages from a USB PD power supply aka turn your devices that use a wall wart into USB C devices. I had a MIDI keyboard that used a 12V wall wart that had a very short cable, so I wanted to make it USB C. This became the use case that we showed in the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/case-for-husb238) and in the [project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2d8Vo-EKs). I added a page to the guide documenting how to check your wall wart supply for the information needed to convert it to USB C with the HUSB238. 

## Upcoming Events!
