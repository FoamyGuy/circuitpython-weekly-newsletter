Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Comparing the 1970's Cray-1 Supercomputer Against the Raspberry Pi Single-Board Computer Range

[![Cray vs Pi](../assets/20240108/20240108cray.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/roy-longbottom-pits-1976-s-cray-1-supercomputer-against-the-raspberry-pi-single-board-computer-range-152bbe2d4111)

Developer Roy Longbottom, who has been personally benchmarking computer systems large and small for more than 50 years, has published a look at how the venerable Cray-1 supercomputer stacks up against modern devices of a considerably smaller scale: the Raspberry Pi family of single-board computers (SBCs) - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/roy-longbottom-pits-1976-s-cray-1-supercomputer-against-the-raspberry-pi-single-board-computer-range-152bbe2d4111).

> "In 1978, the Cray-1 supercomputer cost $7 million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world," Longbottom writes of the device, designed as the flagship product of Seymour Cray's high-performance computing company. "The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD Card), weighs a few ounces, uses a five watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1."

See Longbottom's extensive tests and comparisons article - [roylongbottom.org.uk](http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/Cray%201%20Supercomputer%20Performance%20Comparisons%20With%20Home%20Computers%20Phones%20and%20Tablets.htm).

[![RISC-V assembly board game](../assets/20240108/20240108r5.jpg)](https://punkx.org/overflow/)

PROJEKT: OVERFLOW is a RISC-V assembly board game - [punkx.org](https://punkx.org/overflow/).

> "The game is about creating a small shellcode in memory by copying existing instructions and then exploiting a buffer overflow to jump into it, so that you can overwrite your opponent’s return address to force them to go to the game_over() function.There are other mechanics as well and more layers of strategy (like setting the exception handler or monkeypatching)."

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240108/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).
