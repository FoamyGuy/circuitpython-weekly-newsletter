Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! 2024 is full of possibilities for the electronics industry and for Python running on hardware. Check out this week's crop of articles and projects. - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## MicroPython v1.22.1 Patch Release

[![MicroPython v1.22.1](../assets/20240108/20240108new.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases)

MicroPython v1.22.1 was released to address a specific race condition in using `_thread` in the RP2 port. v1.22.0 has been out since December 27th so the period where the issue has been in effect is short, although it was present in preview builds since November 9th - [GitHub](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases).

## Comparing the 1970's Cray-1 Supercomputer Against the Raspberry Pi Single-Board Computer Range

[![Cray vs Pi](../assets/20240108/20240108cray.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/roy-longbottom-pits-1976-s-cray-1-supercomputer-against-the-raspberry-pi-single-board-computer-range-152bbe2d4111)

Developer Roy Longbottom, who has been personally benchmarking computer systems large and small for more than 50 years, has published a look at how the venerable Cray-1 supercomputer stacks up against modern devices of a considerably smaller scale: the Raspberry Pi family of single-board computers (SBCs) - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/roy-longbottom-pits-1976-s-cray-1-supercomputer-against-the-raspberry-pi-single-board-computer-range-152bbe2d4111).

> "In 1978, the Cray-1 supercomputer cost $7 million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world," Longbottom writes of the device, designed as the flagship product of Seymour Cray's high-performance computing company. "The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD Card), weighs a few ounces, uses a five watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1."

See Longbottom's extensive tests and comparisons article - [roylongbottom.org.uk](http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/Cray%201%20Supercomputer%20Performance%20Comparisons%20With%20Home%20Computers%20Phones%20and%20Tablets.htm).

## In-Depth: Arduino Exploring Manufacturing in India

[![Arduino exploring India manufacturing to limit counterfeit sales](../assets/20240108/20240108aae.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/01/04/techcrunch-arduino-exploring-india-manufacturing-to-limit-counterfeit-sales/)

Last week's newsletter issue covered a TechCrunch article on Arduino saying they might manufacture in India as the software downloads dwarf the sales of hardware. Adafruit's director Phil Torrone writes a follow-up in the Adafruit Blog on Open Source Hardware and Software - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/01/04/techcrunch-arduino-exploring-india-manufacturing-to-limit-counterfeit-sales/) and [Ask an Engineer Segment on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1EER4v5VJns?feature=shared&t=114).

> "What Arduino is calling “fake boards” are primarily Arduino-compatibles and clones, not trademark-infringing counterfeits. Blaming low-cost compatibles and assuming it’s a loss of 3.2 million sales since that’s the download count of the IDE is blaming something that is not really happening. There are counterfeits for sure, but that’s very different than hardware that’s compatible with using the Arduino IDE – the large number of downloads for the open-source Arduino IDE is for compatible board-support-packaged hardware like the ESP8266, ESP32, etc. (Unknown if there’s any telemetry data that lets anyone know what hardware is being used with the IDE, just that it’s downloaded, so we’re going with market indicators, projects published, GitHub repos, and shared online)."

## Project of the Week: Sound Localization with Raspberry Pi and Python

[![Low cost raspberry pi sound localizing Autonomous Recording Unit](../assets/20240108/20240108sound.jpg)](https://github.com/hcfman/sbts-aru)

If you have multiple microphones in known locations, and can determine the time a sound arrives at each one, you can actually determine the location that sound is coming from. This technique is referred to as sound localization via time difference of arrival. Kim Hendrikse decided to put the technique to good use to track down the location of illicit fireworks launches.

The build is based on the Raspberry Pi, with Kim developing an “autonomous recording unit” complete with GPS module for determining their location and keeping everything time synchronized. By deploying a number of these units, spread out over some distance, it’s possible to localize loud sounds based on the time stamps they show up in the recording on each unit - [GitHub](https://github.com/hcfman/sbts-aru), [Medium](https://github.com/hcfman/sbts-aru) and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/12/30/localizing-fireworks-launches-with-a-raspberry-pi/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Melissa**

This past week with it being slow, I decided to add `vectorio` support to [Blinka Displayio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio). While I was in there, I removed Pillow as a requirement, which was only being used to load a font, so the entire library is now pure Python code, which makes it much more portable to other boards.

**Tim**

I took time off over the holiday and New Years. During some downtime I continued work on the `displayio` soft keyboard library. I also worked on the `Blinka_DisplayIO_PyGame_Display` library, it has needed re-writing to work with latest versions of `Blinka_DisplayIO`. It's functional and most of the major issues are tackled now, with only a few smaller quirks to work out.

**Jeff**

Like many folks I have been taking it easy around the end of the year. However, I did do a few things. One of them was to enable the `hashlib` module across many more boards. At this time, the pull request is ready for review.

I'm really proud of what I accomplished in 2023. Here's a GitHub skyline to remember the year by:
