Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We're finally entering Autumn and the students are back to school. The RP2350 issue we reported last week has been officially clarified by Raspberry Pi. CircuitPython has crossed the 4,000 GitHub stars milestone, and Bluetooth 6 is looking good. More on the RP2350 and lots of projects in this issue. I hope you enjoy - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## The Latest on Raspberry Pi Erratum RP2350-E9

[![RP2350 Erratum RP2350-E9](../assets/20240909/20240909e9.jpg)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf)

As reported last week as a developing story, users have reported issues with the Raspberry Pi RP2350 and certain pin behavior. Initially Raspberry Pi addressed this in Erratum RP2350-E9. As of Friday the language in the datasheet has been updated and expanded to reflect the latest research and is now titled "Increased leakage current on Bank 0 GPIO when pad input is enabled" - [Raspberry Pi RP2350 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added:

- [VIDI X](https://circuitpython.org/board/vidi_x/)
- [Tiny FX](https://circuitpython.org/board/pimoroni_tinyfx/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm continuing on merging MicroPython v1.23 into CircuitPython. I've completed all the file merging and reviewed the merges, and I am now working on getting rid of any compilation errors.

**Tim**

I have continued working on 2 main things from last week. The serial plotter in the WebIDE which is coming along nicely and nearly ready for review, and refactoring and expanding upon the intersection check functions that I recently wrote and proposed to add to the core in the vectorio module.

**Jeff**

I added a small feature to the core `StateMachine` object for RP2040/RP2350 microcontrollers. Now it is possible to query a program's load address (via the offset property) and the most recently executing instruction (via the pc property, which is short for "program counter"). These two features can be useful when debugging PIO programs, because they can help you understand which instructions in the program are executing.

**Scott**

I'm still in debugging mode. I found and fixed an issue with USB resume on ESP. I fixed the ReadTheDocs build and got it fixed upstream. Now I'm debugging BLE HID (think bluetooth keyboard) on ESP.
