## Raspberry Pi's New $70 AI Hailo Kit

[![Raspberry Pi AI](../assets/20240610/20240610ai.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/raspberry-pi-targets-edge-ai-partners-with-hailo-for-the-raspberry-pi-ai-kit-abb67721e254)

Raspberry Pi targets Edge AI through a partnership with Hailo for the Raspberry Pi AI Kit - [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/raspberry-pi-targets-edge-ai-partners-with-hailo-for-the-raspberry-pi-ai-kit-abb67721e254) and [PCmag](https://www.pcmag.com/news/raspberry-pi-goes-all-in-on-ai-with-70-hailo-kit).

> "The kit pairs the buyer's existing Raspberry Pi 5, the newest and most powerful model in the popular single-board computer family, with a Hailo-8L M.2 accelerator capable of delivering 13 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of minimum-precision compute for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads. The two devices are mated using the newly-launched Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+, which offers a PCI Express M.2 slot compatible with the accelerator and connects over the Raspberry Pi 5's single externally-accessible PCIe Gen. 2 lane."

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240610/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I continued to work on fixing the remaining issues for CircuitPython 9.1.0 final. Only two or three are left now.

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). I refactored the code to make it much more reliable and fixed the output duplication issue. I am continuing working on finishing up the file operations and fixing certain edge cases as I come upon them.

**Tim**

This week I was focused on the circup repo PR to change from setup.py to pyproject.toml for it's python packaging configuration. I learned a lot about the available configuration options and made some changes to the actions tasks in order to support these changes. The new version is released now. I also soldered up a new cardboard arcade project on a perma-proto bread board, more details to come on that next week.

**Jeff**

I continued working on streaming MP3s over http with CircuitPython on the ESP32-S3. At the time I'm writing this, it sort of works but playback is not reliable enough to permit merging the PR.

**Scott**

This week I've continued work on ESP BLE support. When enabling the BLE workflow, I found some issues with the workflow code that was nRF dependent. I also found bugs in the ESP BLE implementation. So, I'm continuing to use BLE on ESP and fix issues as they are found.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a few product guides. The [Adafruit Chainable DS18B20 Extender Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-chainable-ds18b20-extender-breakout) makes it easy to wire up a DS18B20 temperature sensor. It has the pullup resistor on board, so the sensor becomes plug and play. I also added a minor update to the [RGB LCD Shield guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-lcd-shield) for the new version that is now in the shop. This new version only requires soldering the headers and LCD display.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240610/20240610weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
