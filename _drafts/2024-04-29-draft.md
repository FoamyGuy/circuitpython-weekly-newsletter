Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Big news that broke on Ask an Engineer that Espressif (ESP maker) is taking a stake in M5Stack. Arm and Sony already have invested in Raspberry Pi. New versions of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4S are now out. And an uptick in Python on Pi projects this issue. I hope you enjoy this week's coverage - *Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were two new boards added:

- [ESP32S3-LCD-1.28](https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_esp32_s3_lcd_1_28/)
- [Watchy](https://circuitpython.org/board/sqfmi_watchy/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240429/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **482**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

When a UART device was initialized on ESP32-S3 or ESP32-C3, it could receive a junk byte as the first byte. I fixed this by clearing the input buffer after waiting a short time, based on the baud rate.

I'm now working on adding a user-settable timeout for the socket connect() operation on WiFi-capable boards, to match what is available in CPython. The `lwip` library we use does not support this natively, but it's not too hard to do this "manually".

**Melissa**

This past week I continued working on updating guides. I finished updating the [Turning your Raspberry Pi Zero into a USB Gadget](https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget) guide and addressed feedback in a couple of other guides with only minor changes.

**Tim**

I've been testing many networking PRs in the Wiznet and Requests libraries. This week a new version of Circup was released with the new circup example command that loads examples from circuitpython libraries in the bundle. I'm hoping to make changes in the build-tools or the bundle actions to generate and cache a copy of the examples listing. That could then be fetched from the bundle release page to populate example loading utilities like this one in circup and perhaps some other more visual ones. 

**Scott**

Last week I went to the Zephyr Dev Summit and met a bunch of embedded folks. One group of folks were from [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com/) who make [Renode](https://renode.io/), a microcontroller emulator. I've made [a CircuitPython port to Renode](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9199) so that we can test CircuitPython in the emulator. It makes it much easier to monitor execution and memory access than real hardware.

Now that I'm back from ZDS, I'm getting my teeth into BLE support on ESP chips that support it. Specifically, we don't currently support GATT Server which allows the device to present functionality to another device. We can only do GATT Client now which reads from the other device. I hope to finish support for BLE in ESP so it matches the support on the nRF52840..
