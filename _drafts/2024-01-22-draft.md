## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240122/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I'm experimentally updating the CircuitPython **nrf** port to use the latest version of the **nrfx** library from Nordic. It fixes at least one issue we had to work around in the past, and I'll see what else it improves as well.

**Melissa**

text.

**Tim**

This week I looked into some `DisplayIO` bugs, one related to non built-in Eink displays not refreshing in some cases, and another for the Flip Input widget that is a result of incompatibility with the current version of the `Display_Text` library. I've also started a new game project that will become an Adafruit Learn guide, it's an implementation of a 1 dimensional pacman style game that has a single long hallway map that fits perfectly on one of the very long Qualia displays. I'm planning to mount everything to a cardboard box and print out some decals for the outside that are inspired by the original game's arcade cabinet.

**Jeff**

I've continued to work on the pull request to add "bitmapfilter", a small collection of routines for manipulating bitmaps. Since the last update, I added a routine for false color mapping and one for applying look-up tables to image channels.

**Scott**

Last week I was away visiting family. This week I'm getting caught up and wrapping up the SD card over WiFi and BLE support.

**Liz**

This week I worked on two new product guides: the 3.5" capacitive touch TFT FeatherWing and the MCP3421, which is an 18-bit ADC. Both guides have pages for overview, pinouts, CircuitPython, Arduino and resources for download. I also worked on some code for the NeoPixel Rotary Fidget project. I was able to incorporate a smaller version of an older project, the NeoPixel run game, which the Ruiz brothers and I had wanted to do for quite some time.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240122/20240122weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
