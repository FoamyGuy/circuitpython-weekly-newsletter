## Project of the Week: Detecting Ghost Aircraft with Python

[![Detecting Ghost Aircraft with Python](../assets/20231218/20231218ghost.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-detects-ghost-aircraft-using-sdr)

Angelina Tsuboi has created what she calls Fly Catcher — a Raspberry Pi-powered system that can detect false aircraft using Automatic Dependent Surveillance. Fly Catcher works by monitoring the 1090MHz frequency and can determine whether or not a potential aircraft is genuine thanks to a neural network developed just for this project, with the app coded in Python - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-detects-ghost-aircraft-using-sdr), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NJ9ep0IlddA) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ANG13T/fly-catcher).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were six new boards added:

- [WisdPi Tiny RP2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/wisdpi_tiny_rp2040/)
- [WisdPi Ardu2040M](https://circuitpython.org/board/wisdpi_ardu2040m/)
- [Wireless Sensor Core WSC-1450](https://circuitpython.org/board/pctel_wsc_1450/)
- [Maker Uno RP2040](https://circuitpython.org/board/cytron_maker_uno_rp2040/)
- [A20-OLinuXino-LIME2](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/olimex_a20_lime2/) (Blinka)
- [Orange Pi 5 Plus](https://circuitpython.org/blinka/orange_pi_5_plus/) (Blinka)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20231218/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.6 last week, about a month after alpha.5. Alpha.6 has jpegio courtesy Jeff, and about 50 other fixes and improvements.

I'm continuing to debug issues with the NINA-FW firmware used on AirLift boards, now with Ha Thach's help. Some things that did not work a couple of months ago are now working, which is quite confusing.

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on updating the [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) website to allow using multiple URLs with each board. This is in preparation for a new feature on the Adafruit website to identify boards that can run CircuitPython. I also updated the Arduino library used for the Qualia displays to add a new parameter similar to CircuitPython so that a couple of bar displays that require an overscan parameter can be used.

**Tim**

This week I used a recently utility I added recently to Adabot to release all of the libraries that were changed by the patch rollout from last week. As with the patch itself there were a few that the utility didn't work on so I tracked them down and fixed various infrastructure issues to get them sorted out. I believe I'm nearing the end of the work in circup to refactor proposed addition of support for web workflow.

**Jeff**

Last week I added support for jpeg decoding in CircuitPython, which has appeared in the latest release. We enabled the new `jpegio` module on as many boards as we could. I'm in the process of making an adaptation of an existing guide to use `jpegio` and qualia instead of using Adafruit IO to convert a JPEG image to a format that CircuitPython can handle.

**Scott**

This week I've been around off and on. I've been keeping up with emails and reviews but not a ton else. My main focus is to add SD card support to the BLE and web workflows. To make that easier, I'm doing a bit of refactoring to share code and clarify how filesystems are locked. The locking will prevent one workflow from reading while another is in the middle of a something. An interrupted change can look like corruption and an interrupted read could slow both reads down.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a CircuitPython library for the FT5336 capacitive touch driver and [updated the associated guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-3-5-color-320x480-tft-touchscreen-breakout) for the new 3.5" 480x320 display. This driver allows for up to 5 simultaneous touch points and the libraries for both Arduino and CircuitPython can keep track of the coordinates for each touch in a list which could make for some interesting projects. I also finally setup a Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm. I had been putting it off because I had heard about all of the changes for Python but the [updated Blinka guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) made everything go very smoothly.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20231218/20231218weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
