Using Picamera2 on a Raspberry Pi SBC isn’t difficult, but for some the pure Python interface can be challenging. James Mitchell has created Picamera2 Web UI Lite, a web interface for Picamera2 which provides a full suite of camera settings to tweak, along with an image gallery where we can view and download images - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/how-to-control-your-raspberry-pi-camera-using-a-web-ui).

CircuitPython statistics: [Pull Request #9000](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/9000) was recently opened by a community member in CircuitPython. As the same pool of numbers is used for issues and for PRs so it's not accurate to call it the "9000th pull request" but it is very significant (it is actually about the 5100th pull request) - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I fixed some remaining nRF bugs for CircuitPython 9.0.0. We are now ready for a release candidate, and there may well be one by the time you read this.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20240311/20240311melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I continued working on updating Pi_Eyes. I now have it resizing and displaying the desktop successfully on the displays. However, it is running very slow with the biggest delay being in the SPI transfer. Next up will be figuring that issue out so the display updates happen in real time.

**Tim**

**Jeff**

I fixed some bugs in CircuitPython 9, including improving a situation where having an SD card and a display that share an SPI bus caused problems accessing the SD card through the web workflow.

A second bug I fixed was how "timeout" errors were signaled for SSL sockets. There was a long-standing bug on the Pico W, which began affecting the Espressif-family microcontrollers after another change I made to share the SSL code between the processor families.

I have some other long term items that are cooking but those are on hold while we work on getting version 9 stable and ready for wide use.

**Scott**

This week I've done three more fixes for CircuitPython 9.0.0 and have run out of things to debug. So, 9.0.0 is close and I'll keep an eye out for subsequent issues to fix. Thanks to everyone who has tested it and filed issues!

**Liz**

This week I wrote up two guides. The first was the [OpenAI Image Descriptors with MEMENTO project](https://learn.adafruit.com/openai-image-descriptors-with-memento). The CircuitPython code lets you connect to WiFi, take a photo, send the photo to OpenAI with their API and then save the response as a text file. I included six different prompts to get folks started. This was really fun to work on. I loved coming up with the prompts and figuring out how to add different text to the MEMENTO display with the PyCamera library and review images on the microSD card.

The second guide was for the [Adafruit STEMMA Analog SPDT Switch](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-analog-spdt-switch). This was just added to the shop and lets you switch between two analog signals. For the demo, I switched between two waveforms generated by one of my synth modules (Pamela's New Workout for those who are into Eurorack). It was really cool to be able to see the waveforms switch in the Serial Plotter as the input pin was toggled.

One special thing that happened this week was that I went on [JP's Product Pick of the Week show](https://youtu.be/MsXNsj2iqQo). The product pick was the [3.5" TFT FeatherWing with Capacitive Touch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5872). I helped to demo the multi-touch functionality for the display with CircuitPython. The code has four touchscreen buttons that can detect if they contain the touch point. I added the demo to the [examples for the FT5336 touch library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FT5336/blob/main/examples/buttons_example.py) since I think it could be helpful for folks who want to make projects with UI elements.

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240311/20240311weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
