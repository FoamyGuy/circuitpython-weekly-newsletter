## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240311/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I fixed some remaining nRF bugs for CircuitPython 9.0.0. We are now ready for a release candidate, and there may well be one by the time you read this.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20240311/20240311melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This week I continued working on updating Pi_Eyes. I now have it resizing and displaying the desktop successfully on the displays. However, it is running very slow with the biggest delay being in the SPI transfer. Next up will be figuring that issue out so the display updates happen in real time.

**Tim**

**Jeff**

I fixed some bugs in CircuitPython 9, including improving a situation where having an SD card and a display that share an SPI bus caused problems accessing the SD card through the web workflow.

A second bug I fixed was how "timeout" errors were signaled for SSL sockets. There was a long-standing bug on the Pico W, which began affecting the Espressif-family microcontrollers after another change I made to share the SSL code between the processor families.

I have some other long term items that are cooking but those are on hold while we work on getting version 9 stable and ready for wide use.

**Scott**

This week I've done three more fixes for CircuitPython 9.0.0 and have run out of things to debug. So, 9.0.0 is close and I'll keep an eye out for subsequent issues to fix. Thanks to everyone who has tested it and filed issues!

**Liz**

This week I wrote up two guides. The first was the [OpenAI Image Descriptors with MEMENTO project](https://learn.adafruit.com/openai-image-descriptors-with-memento). The CircuitPython code lets you connect to WiFi, take a photo, send the photo to OpenAI with their API and then save the response as a text file. I included six different prompts to get folks started. This was really fun to work on. I loved coming up with the prompts and figuring out how to add different text to the MEMENTO display with the PyCamera library and review images on the microSD card.

The second guide was for the [Adafruit STEMMA Analog SPDT Switch](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-analog-spdt-switch). This was just added to the shop and lets you switch between two analog signals. For the demo, I switched between two waveforms generated by one of my synth modules (Pamela's New Workout for those who are into Eurorack). It was really cool to be able to see the waveforms switch in the Serial Plotter as the input pin was toggled.

One special thing that happened this week was that I went on [JP's Product Pick of the Week show](https://youtu.be/MsXNsj2iqQo). The product pick was the [3.5" TFT FeatherWing with Capacitive Touch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5872). I helped to demo the multi-touch functionality for the display with CircuitPython. The code has four touchscreen buttons that can detect if they contain the touch point. I added the demo to the [examples for the FT5336 touch library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FT5336/blob/main/examples/buttons_example.py) since I think it could be helpful for folks who want to make projects with UI elements.
