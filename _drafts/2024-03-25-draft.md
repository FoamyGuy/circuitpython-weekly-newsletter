## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240325/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I made the release for CircuitPython 9.0.0 final last Monday! Users are beginning to switch over. A few have noted some regressions and we are working on those.

We are also moving ahead on changes for 9.1 and later. I did a simple housekeeping task of renaming `ports/nrf` to `ports/nordic`. Most of the port names are different from what MicroPython uses, but we both used `ports/nrf`. Changing the name will make merges from upstream easier.

**Melissa**

**Tim**

This week I cleaned up and submitted the PR for `OutlinedLabel` class to the `Display Text` library. This new class allows you to make labels with specified color and size of stroke outline. I've also been writing new examples for the `adafruit_rsa` library that saves and loads keys from files rather than generating new ones each time the script is run. Lastly I've been experimenting with the ruff code format and linting tool in some local instances of library repos. We are considering migrating the libraries to use this tool instead of pylint and black. MicroPython has already adopted it's usage as well so it will be a step toward closer consistency in the ecosystem.

**Scott**

This week I've entered a post-release phase because 9.0.0 has been released! Generally my work on the release stops a little beforehand as we wait to see if any issues pop up. Since then I've continued to poke a Hancho based CP build, started adding USB host FeatherWing support to CP and updating the ESP-IDF to 5.2.1. The latter two things will likely be released in 9.1.0. 

**Liz**

This week I worked on some product guides for the new PiCowbells in the shop. These PiCowbells make it easier to prototype with the Pico boards. There's one with [terminal blocks](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-terminal-picowbell-for-pico) and two that are similar to the Proto FeatherWings with [single](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-proto-under-plate-picowbell) and [doubler](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-proto-doubler-picowbell) options. Whenever I work on projects, I try to choose components that make wiring and assembly simple for folks, so having these options with mounting holes, GPIO labels, STEMMA QT connectors and reset buttons available is great.
