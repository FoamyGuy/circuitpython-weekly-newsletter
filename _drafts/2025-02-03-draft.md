## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20250203/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**Tim**

This week I've been working on the examples and guide pages for the new Sparkle Motion device. Many of the examples are the same as the ones featured in the Mini Sparkle Motion guide, but I did create a new one to demonstrate usage of the IR receiver. I've been using the CircuitPython web editor a lot while working on the examples and I'm using the beta branch in order to test out the features not in the live version yet, I've documented a few issues that I've found and intend to look into. Next I'll be working on Raspberry Pi 5 w/ RGB Matrixes using the Blinka compatibility layer.

**Jeff**

I released `[adafuit_rp1pio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Raspberry_Pi5_rp1pio)`, a subset of the CircuitPython `rp2pio` module. This enables use of the Programmed I/O (pio) peripheral in the Raspberry Pi 5 computer from Python code.

**Scott**

This week I'm continuing to work on the CircuitPython Zephyr port. I got WiFi scanning working on the nRF7002 DK. I meant to get connecting working but got distracted by build improvements. The build improvements were my next TODO so it's ok to work on too. It is needed before we can PR it to the main repo and release new boards based on it. We're getting closer to an alpha port that will be released for testing.
