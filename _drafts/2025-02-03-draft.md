Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! *insert 2-3 sentences from editor (what's in overview, banter)* - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/circuitpython.org) and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 9.2.4 Released

[![CircuitPython 9.2.4 Released](../assets/20250203/20250203cp9p.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/28/circuitpython-9-2-4-released/)

CircuitPython 9.2.4 is the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython and is a new stable release - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/28/circuitpython-9-2-4-released/) and release notes - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/9.2.4).

**Highlights of this release**

* Update frozen modules, including a fix for `adafruit_requests`.
* `audiofilters`: add `Distortion` and implement LFO ticking.
* Add `canio` support for i.MX boards.
* Fix RP2 `picodvi` crash.
* Fix STM USB crashes.

## Focus on AI/ML for Microcontrollers and Single Board Computers

You may notice that this newsletter avoids fads, instead looking to highlight things that can actually be done with hardware and software we might actually obtain. Here are three articles I found which address just that.

[![New Neural Network Slashes Sensor-Data Overload](../assets/20250203/20250203ieee.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/sensor-data)

While most models take in terabytes and need high end compute to process and provide results, IEEE Spectrum highlights Pennsylvania State University and MIT's paper, published in Nature Scientific Reports, which demonstrates how a neural network can achieve an accuracy of more than 90 percent while sampling as little as 10 percent of the original sensor data.

To punctuate this, they use a Raspberry Pi Pico running their software - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/sensor-data).

[![Deepseek R1 on a Raspberry Pi](../assets/20250203/20250203deep.jpg)](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-deepseek-r1-on-raspberry-pi)

Deepseek, a new AI startup run by a Chinese hedge fund, *allegedly* created a new open weights model called R1 that beats OpenAI's best model in every metric. Besides the embarassment of a Chinese startup beating OpenAI using one percent of the resources (according to Deepseek), their model can 'distill' other models to make them run better on slower hardware. Jeff Geerling tests this out using a Raspberry Pi 5 connected to a PC GPU/graphics card - [JeffGeerling.com](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/how-deepseek-r1-on-raspberry-pi) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o1sN1lB76EA).

[![Ethical Coding LLMs](../assets/20250203/20250203ieee2.jpg)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/coding-ai)

[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) was founded in 2016 to collect and preserve all publicly available source code. After the ChatGPT explosion, it quickly became clear that Software Heritage held the largest dataset for training AI models on code in the world. Another IEEE Spectrum article delves into ethical coding of AIs, data cleaning, opt-out, personal information in open code, license checks, and more - [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/coding-ai).

## ESP32-C5 Engineering Samples Are Out

[![ESP32-C5](../assets/20250203/20250203c5.jpg)](https://circuitdigest.com/news/breaking-barriers-espressifs-esp32-c5-brings-5-ghz-wi-fi-to-iot-devices)

The ESP32-C5 is the first 32-bit single-core RISC-V-based MCU from Espressif to support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi 6, along with Bluetooth 5 (LE) and IEEE 802.15.4 standards. The dual-band support opens new possibilities for IoT applications, allowing devices to operate on the less crowded 5 GHz band for lower latency and more reliable connectivity. The inclusion of advanced WiFi 6 features such as Target Wake Time (TWT), MU-MIMO, and OFDMA ensures improved performance in dense network environments - [Circuit Digest](https://circuitdigest.com/news/breaking-barriers-espressifs-esp32-c5-brings-5-ghz-wi-fi-to-iot-devices), [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c5) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEvHRHdboA).

## CircuitPython Pull Request Milestones

[![CircuitPython Pull Request Milestones](../assets/20250203/20250203pr.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10000)

CircuitPython reached a milestone with Pull Request number Ten Thousand made by Jeff Epler. Also CircuitPython  blew past the milestone of 5000 *merged PRs* sometime last year, with a total 5,143 merged PRs at the moment - [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10000).

## Raspberry Pi Programmable IO Pitfalls - Part 2

[![Raspberry Pi Programmable IO Pitfalls](../assets/20250203/20250203pio2.jpg)](https://towardsdatascience.com/nine-pico-pio-wats-with-micropython-part-2-984a642f25a4)

Part 2 of an exploration into the unexpected quirks of programming the Raspberry Pi Pico PIO with MicroPython. In [Part 1](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/nine-pico-pio-wats-with-micropython-part-1-82b80fb84473) (in the last issue of this newsletter), there were four challenge assumptions about register count, instruction slots, the behavior of pull(noblock), and smart yet cheap hardware - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/nine-pico-pio-wats-with-micropython-part-2-984a642f25a4).

## Whatâ€™s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Letâ€™s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.2.4 last week to fix some board builds that were not working. I'm continuing to fix bugs for future 9.x.x. releases, alternating that work with continuing work on getting CircuitMatter to run on CircuitPython.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on the examples and guide pages for the new Sparkle Motion device. Many of the examples are the same as the ones featured in the Mini Sparkle Motion guide, but I did create a new one to demonstrate usage of the IR receiver. I've been using the CircuitPython web editor a lot while working on the examples and I'm using the beta branch in order to test out the features not in the live version yet, I've documented a few issues that I've found and intend to look into. Next I'll be working on Raspberry Pi 5 w/ RGB Matrixes using the Blinka compatibility layer.

**Jeff**

I released `[adafuit_rp1pio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Raspberry_Pi5_rp1pio)`, a subset of the CircuitPython `rp2pio` module. This enables use of the Programmed I/O (pio) peripheral in the Raspberry Pi 5 computer from Python code.

**Scott**

This week I'm continuing to work on the CircuitPython Zephyr port. I got WiFi scanning working on the nRF7002 DK. I meant to get connecting working but got distracted by build improvements. The build improvements were my next TODO so it's ok to work on too. It is needed before we can PR it to the main repo and release new boards based on it. We're getting closer to an alpha port that will be released for testing.
