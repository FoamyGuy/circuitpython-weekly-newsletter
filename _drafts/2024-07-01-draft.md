Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! As more Northern Hemisphere Python folks take their vacations, the Raspberry Pi folks are garnering additional headlines. EuroPython is coming in a week and it'll be spectacular. I packed the In the News section this week for you to round things out. - *Anne Barela, Editor*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Which Raspberry Pi Model To Buy In 2024: A Complete Guide

[![Which Raspberry Pi Model To Buy In 2024: A Complete Guide](../assets/20240701/20240701pi.jpg)](https://raspberrytips.com/best-raspberry-pi-model/)

With so many Raspberry Pi buying options available, choosing the right one can be challenging. RaspberryTips explains the most important things to consider to help make the right choice for ones needs. - [RaspberryTips](https://raspberrytips.com/best-raspberry-pi-model/).

## Raspberry Pi Connect: Remote Shell Access and Support For Older Devices

[![Raspberry Pi Connect: remote shell access and support for older devices](../assets/20240701/20240701ssh.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect-remote-shell-access-and-support-for-older-devices/)

Raspberry Pi is bringing Raspberry Pi Connect to even more devices. A new release includes remote shell access and support for all Raspberry Pi computers, whether they’re running Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit or 64-bit, going all the way back to the 2012 Raspberry Pi 1. This includes Raspberry Pi OS Lite, as well as versions of Raspberry Pi OS with the desktop.<br> <br>The new remote shell feature in Raspberry Pi Connect enables you to launch a shell on your Raspberry Pi device from a web browser, over a secure connection (similar to SSH but more secure) - [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect-remote-shell-access-and-support-for-older-devices/).

## Project of the Week: The SPOKE Capacitive Touch Board

[![SPOKE Capacitive Touch Board](../assets/20240701/20240701spoke.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/06/26/a-capacitive-touch-board-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico/)

Tom Fox's SPOKE board is an easy way to add up to 26 touch sensors to projects for interaction. Anything with capacitive potential can be connected to the pins and used to control computer inputs. Create your own USB MIDI device, game controller, key mapper or other computer interface device by attaching metallic objects, conductive inks, conductive threads, fruits, plants, vegetables, cutlery, car keys, mushrooms etc. or use it as a standalone device. The custom circuit board houses a Raspberry Pi Pico. USB MIDI and keyboard are accommodated via CircuitPython code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tom-Vulpes/Spoke/tree/main) - [Project Website](https://www.spokeboard.com/), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/8bxbrVFYZEk), and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/06/26/a-capacitive-touch-board-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but several are in progress.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

Last week I fixed three CircuitPython Espressif BLE bugs. Espressif BLE is now working well with multiple BLE peripherals. There's one more bug to fix related to advertising the BLE workflow that's causing big delays on ESP32. The number of CircuitPython 9.1.0 bugs is again getting close to zero.

**Tim**

This week I looked into an issue with the device specific board stubs and worked on a fix that allows them to be used with Python 3.9. I have also been continuing work on integrating the BLE workflow support into Circup / wwshell. I incorporated the first few basic PoC bleak scripts into the wwshell commands, right now listdir and read are implemented and working in my branch.

**Jeff**

I've spent the past few weeks learning about Zigbee. While the code I wrote as a result isn't suitable for including in CircuitPython, I did put the code in a [branch](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/compare/main...jepler:zigbee-prototype?expand=1).

I used this prototype code on an ESP32-C6 devkit together with an Espressif Zigbee "light switch" built with ESP-IDF to toggle an LED on and off. It's a simple demo, but it does show that there's potential to integrate Zigbee or other protocols, based on 802.15.4, into CircuitPython.

**Scott**

I've been out off and on because family has been in town. I have been doing some flash debugging with the Saleae and tweaked [their Simple Parallel analyzer](https://github.com/saleae/simple-parallel-analyzer) to [depend on a chip select signal](https://github.com/tannewt/simple-parallel-analyzer-with-cs). This improves analysis of captured QSPI flash traffic by [the higher level analyzer](https://github.com/adafruit/Logic2-SPIFlash/pull/10) because it had to guess when transactions ended based on clock gaps.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a guide for the [HX711 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hx711-24-bit-adc). It is a 24-bit ADC for strain gauges. I wrote a CircuitPython library to interface with the chip as well.

I've also been working on a PCB design for the Ikea Vindriktning air quality monitor. Ladyada discussed this a bit on her [Desk of Ladyada stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/viokTEHmqZs). We're putting together a PCB with an ESP32-S2 that will fit inside the housing and connect to the PM1006 sensor inside. To check the component clearance, I 3D printed the board with the components. You can do this with Eagle and Fusion360 by following along with [the guide by the Ruiz Brothers](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-convert-eagle-pcbs-to-3d-models-in-fusion-360).

## Call for Help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20240701/20240701weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)
